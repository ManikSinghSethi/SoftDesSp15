I will only say that while I have\r\nstriven to be as faithful as I could to the words as well as to the\r\nsense of my author, the following translation is not offered as being\r\nalways closely literal. The kind of verse employed I believe to be that\r\nbest fitted to give some idea, however faint, of the rigidly measured\r\nand yet easy strength of Dante\'s _terza rima_; but whoever chooses to\r\nadopt it with its constantly recurring demand for rhymes necessarily\r\nbecomes in some degree its servant. Such students as wish to follow the\r\npoet word by word will always find what they need in Dr. J. A. Carlyle\'s\r\nexcellent prose version of the _Inferno_, a work to which I have to\r\nacknowledge my own indebtedness at many points.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the notes, it is needless to say, has been in very great\r\npart found ready to my hand in existing Commentaries. My edition of John\r\nVillani is that of Florence, 1823.\r\n\r\nThe Note at page cx was printed before it had been resolved to provide\r\nthe volume with a copy of Giotto\'s portrait of Dante. I have to thank\r\nthe Council of the Arundel Society for their kind permission to Messrs.\r\nDawson to make use of their lithograph of Mr. Seymour Kirkup\'s\r\ninvaluable sketch in the production of the Frontispiece--a privilege\r\nthat would have been taken more advantage of had it not been deemed\r\nadvisable to work chiefly from the photograph of the same sketch, given\r\nin the third volume of the late Lord Vernon\'s sumptuous and rare edition\r\nof the _Inferno_ (Florence, 1865). In this Vernon photograph, as well as\r\nin the Arundel Society\'s chromolithograph, the disfiguring mark on the\r\nface caused by the damage to the plaster of the fresco is faithfully\r\nreproduced. A less degree of fidelity has been observed in the\r\nFrontispiece; although the restoration has not been carried the length\r\nof replacing the lost eye.\r\n\r\nEDINBURGH, _February_,

AND DANTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDante is himself the hero of the _Divine Comedy_, and ere many stages of\r\nthe _Inferno_ have been passed the reader feels that all his steps are\r\nbeing taken in a familiar companionship. When every allowance has been\r\nmade for what the exigencies of art required him to heighten or\r\nsuppress, it is still impossible not to be convinced that the author is\r\nrevealing himself much as he really was--in some of his weakness as well\r\nas in all his strength. The poem itself, by many an unconscious touch,\r\ndoes for his moral portraiture what the pencil of Giotto has done for\r\nthe features of his face. The one likeness answers marvellously to the\r\nother; and, together, they have helped the world to recognise in him the\r\ngreat example of a man of genius who, though at first sight he may seem\r\nto be austere, is soon found to attract our love by the depth of his\r\nfeelings as much as he wins our admiration by the wealth of his fancy,\r\nand by the clearness of his judgment on everything concerned with the\r\nlives and destiny of men. His other writings in greater or less degree\r\nconfirm the impression of Dante\'s character to be obtained from the\r\n_Comedy_. Some of them are partly autobiographical; and, studying as a\r\nwhole all that is left to us of him, we can gain a general notion of\r\nthe nature of his career--when he was born and what was his condition in\r\nlife; his early loves and friendships; his studies, military service,\r\nand political aims; his hopes and illusions, and the weary purgatory of\r\nhis exile.\r\n\r\nTo the knowledge of Dante\'s life and character which is thus to be\r\nacquired, the formal biographies of him have but little to add that is\r\nboth trustworthy and of value. Something of course there is in the\r\ntraditional story of his life that has come down from his time with the\r\nseal of genuineness; and something that has been ascertained by careful\r\nresearch among Florentine and other documents. But when all that old and\r\nmodern _Lives_ have to tell us has been sifted, the additional facts\r\nregarding him are found to be but few; such at least as are beyond\r\ndispute. Boccaccio, his earliest biographer, swells out his _Life_, as\r\nthe earlier commentators on the _Comedy_ do their notes, with what are\r\nplainly but legendary amplifications of hints supplied by Dante\'s own\r\nwords; while more recent and critical writers succeed with infinite\r\npains in little beyond establishing, each to his own satisfaction, what\r\nwas the order of publication of the poet\'s works, where he may have\r\ntravelled to, and when and for how long a time he may have had this or\r\nthat great lord for a patron.\r\n\r\nA very few pages would therefore be enough to tell the events of Dante\'s\r\nlife as far as they are certainly known. But, to be of use as an\r\nintroduction to the study of his great poem, any biographical sketch\r\nmust contain some account--more or less full--of Florentine affairs\r\nbefore and during his lifetime; for among the actors in these are to be\r\nfound many of the persons of the _Comedy_. In reading the poem we are\r\nnever suffered for long to forget his exile. From one point of view it\r\nis an appeal to future ages from Florentine injustice and ingratitude;\r\nfrom another, it is a long and passionate plea with his native town to\r\nshake her in her stubborn cruelty. In spite of the worst she can do\r\nagainst him he remains no less her son. In the early copies of it, the\r\n_Comedy_ is well described as the work of Dante Alighieri, the\r\nFlorentine; since not only does he people the other world by preference\r\nwith Florentines, but it is to Florence that, even when his words are\r\nbitter against her, his heart is always feeling back. Among the glories\r\nof Paradise he loves to let his memory rest on the church in which he\r\nwas baptized and the streets he used to tread. He takes pleasure in her\r\nstones; and with her towers and palaces Florence stands for the\r\nunchanging background to the changing scenes of his mystical pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nThe history of Florence during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries\r\nagrees in general outline with that of most of its neighbours. At the\r\nbeginning of the period it was a place of but little importance, ranking\r\nfar below Pisa both in wealth and political influence. Though retaining\r\nthe names and forms of municipal government, inherited from early times,\r\nit was in reality possessed of no effective control over its own\r\naffairs, and was subject to its feudal superior almost as completely as\r\nwas ever any German village planted in the shadow of a castle. To\r\nFlorence, as to many a city of Northern and Central Italy, the first\r\nopportunity of winning freedom came with the contest between Emperor\r\nand Pope in the time of Hildebrand. In this quarrel the Church found its\r\nbest ally in Matilda, Countess of Tuscany. She, to secure the goodwill\r\nof her subjects as against the Emperor, yielded first one and then\r\nanother of her rights in Florence, generally by way of a pious gift--an\r\nendowment for a religious house or an increase of jurisdiction to the\r\nbishop--these concessions, however veiled, being in effect so many\r\nadditions to the resources and liberties of the townsmen. She made Rome\r\nher heir, and then Florence was able to play off the Papal against the\r\nImperial claims, yielding a kind of barren homage to both Emperor and\r\nPope, and only studious to complete a virtual independence of both.\r\nFlorence had been Matilda\'s favourite place of residence; and,\r\nbenefiting largely as it did by her easy rule, it is no wonder that her\r\nname should have been cherished by the Florentines for ages after as a\r\nhousehold word.[1] Nor is the greatest Florentine unmindful of her. Foe\r\nof the Empire though she was, he only remembers her piety; and it is by\r\nMatilda, as representing the active religious life, that Dante is\r\nushered into the presence of Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise.[2]\r\n\r\nIt was a true instinct which led Florence and other cities to side\r\nrather with the Pope than with the Emperor in the long-continued\r\nstruggle between them for predominance in Italy. With the Pope for\r\noverlord they would at least have a master who was an Italian, and one\r\nwho, his title being imperfect, would in his own interest be led to\r\ntreat them with indulgence; while, in the permanent triumph of the\r\nEmperor, Italy must have become subject and tributary to Germany, and\r\nwould have seen new estates carved out of her fertile soil for members\r\nof the German garrison. The danger was brought home to many of the\r\nyouthful commonwealths during the eventful reign of Frederick Barbarossa\r\n(1152-1190). Strong in Germany beyond most of his predecessors, that\r\nmonarch ascended the throne with high prerogative views, in which he was\r\nconfirmed by the slavish doctrine of some of the new civilians.\r\nAccording to these there could be only one master in the world; as far\r\nas regarded the things of time, but one source of authority in\r\nChristendom. They maintained everything to be the Emperor\'s that he\r\nchose to take. When he descended into Italy to enforce his claims, the\r\ncities of the Lombard League met him in open battle. Those of Tuscany,\r\nand especially Florence, bent before the blast, temporising as long as\r\nthey were able, and making the best terms they could when the choice lay\r\nbetween submission and open revolt. Even Florence, it is true, strong in\r\nher allies, did once take arms against an Imperial lieutenant; but as a\r\nrule she never refused obedience in words, and never yielded it in fact\r\nbeyond what could not be helped. In her pursuit of advantages,\r\nskilfully using every opportunity, and steadfast of aim even when most\r\nshe appeared to waver, she displayed something of the same address that\r\nwas long to be noted as a trait in the character of the individual\r\nFlorentine.\r\n\r\nThe storm was weathered, although not wholly without loss. When, towards\r\nthe close of his life, and after he had broken his strength against the\r\nobstinate patriotism of Lombardy, Frederick visited Florence in 1185, it\r\nwas as a master justly displeased with servants who, while they had not\r\nopenly rebelled against him, had yet proved eminently unprofitable, and\r\nwhom he was concerned to punish if not to destroy. On the complaint of\r\nthe neighbouring nobles, that they were oppressed and had been plundered\r\nby the city, he gave orders for the restoration to them of their lands\r\nand castles. This accomplished, all the territory left to Florence was a\r\nnarrow belt around the walls. Villani even says that for the four years\r\nduring which Frederick still lived the Commonwealth was wholly landless.\r\nAnd here, rather than lose ourselves among the endless treaties,\r\nleagues, and campaigns which fill so many pages of the chronicles, it\r\nmay be worth while shortly to glance at the constitution of Florentine\r\nsociety, and especially at the place held in it by the class which found\r\nits protector in Barbarossa.\r\n\r\nMuch about the time at which the Commonwealth was relieved of its feudal\r\ntrammels, as a result of the favour or the necessities of Matilda, it\r\nwas beginning to extend its commerce and increase its industry. Starting\r\nsomewhat late on the career on which Venice, Genoa, and Pisa were\r\nalready far advanced, Florence was as if strenuous to make up for lost\r\ntime, and soon displayed a rare comprehension of the nature of the\r\nenterprise. It may be questioned if ever, until quite modern times,\r\nthere has been anywhere so clear an understanding of the truth that\r\npublic wellbeing is the sum of private prosperity, or such an\r\nenlightened perception of what tends to economical progress. Florence\r\nhad no special command of raw material for her manufactures, no sea-port\r\nof her own, and no monopoly unless in the natural genius of her people.\r\nShe could therefore thrive only by dint of holding open her\r\ncommunications with the world at large, and grudged no pains either of\r\nwar or diplomacy to keep at Pisa a free way out and in for her\r\nmerchandise. Already in the twelfth century she received through that\r\nport the rough woollens of Flanders, which, after being skilfully\r\ndressed and dyed, were sent out at great profit to every market of\r\nEurope. At a somewhat later period the Florentines were to give as\r\nstrong a proof of their financial capacity as this was of their\r\nindustrial. It was they who first conducted a large business in bills of\r\nexchange, and who first struck a gold coin which, being kept of\r\ninvariable purity, passed current in every land where men bought and\r\nsold--even in countries where the very name of Florence was unknown.[3]\r\n\r\nIn a community thus devoted to industry and commerce, it was natural\r\nthat a great place should be filled by merchants. These were divided\r\ninto six guilds, the members of which, with the notaries and lawyers,\r\nwho composed a seventh, formed the true body of the citizens.\r\nOriginally the consuls of these guilds were the only elected officials\r\nin the city, and in the early days of its liberty they were even charged\r\nwith political duties, and are found, for example, signing a treaty of\r\npeace with a neighbouring state. In the fully developed commune it was\r\nonly the wealthier citizens--the members, we may assume, of these\r\nguilds--who, along with the nobles,[4] were eligible for and had the\r\nright of electing to the public offices. Below them was the great body\r\nof the people; all, that is, of servile condition or engaged in the\r\nmeaner kinds of business. From one point of view, the liberties of the\r\ncitizens were only their privileges. But although the labourers and\r\nhumbler tradesmen were without franchises, their interests were not\r\ntherefore neglected, being bound up with those of the one or two\r\nthousand citizens who shared with the patricians the control of public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThere were two classes of nobles with whom Florence had to reckon as she\r\nawoke to life--those within the walls, and those settled in the\r\nneighbouring country. In later times it was a favourite boast among the\r\nnoble citizens--a boast indulged in by Dante--that they were descended\r\nfrom ancient Roman settlers on the banks of the Arno. A safer boast\r\nwould in many cases have been that their ancestors had come to Italy in\r\nthe train of Otho and other conquering Emperors. Though settled in the\r\ncity, in some cases for generations, the patrician families were not\r\naltogether of it, being distinguished from the other citizens, if not\r\nalways by the possession of ancestral landward estates, at least by\r\ntheir delight in war and contempt for honest industry. But with the\r\nfaults of a noble class they had many of its good qualities. Of these\r\nthe Republic suffered them to make full proof, allowing them to lead in\r\nwar and hold civil offices out of all proportion to their numbers.\r\n\r\nLike the city itself, the nobles in the country around had been feudally\r\nsubject to the Marquis of Tuscany. After Matilda\'s death they claimed to\r\nhold direct from the Empire; which meant in practice to be above all\r\nlaw. They exercised absolute jurisdiction over their serfs and\r\ndependants, and, when favoured by the situation of their castles, took\r\ntoll, like the robber barons of Germany, of the goods which passed\r\nbeneath their walls. Already they had proved to be thorns in the side of\r\nthe industrious burghers; but at the beginning of the twelfth century\r\ntheir neighbourhood became intolerable, and for a couple of generations\r\nthe chief political work of Florence was to bring them to reason. Those\r\nwhose lands came up almost to the city gates were first dealt with, and\r\nthen in a widening circle the country was cleared of the pest. Year\r\nafter year, when the days were lengthening out in spring, the roughly\r\norganised city militia was mustered, war was declared against some\r\nspecially obnoxious noble and his fortress was taken by surprise, or,\r\nfailing that, was subjected to a siege. In the absence of a more\r\ndefinite grievance, it was enough to declare his castle dangerously near\r\nthe city. These expeditions were led by the nobles who were already\r\ncitizens, while the country neighbours of the victim looked on with\r\nindifference, or even helped to waste the lands or force the stronghold\r\nof a rival. The castle once taken, it was either levelled with the\r\nground, or was restored to the owner on condition of his yielding\r\nservice to the Republic. And, both by way of securing a hold upon an\r\nunwilling vassal and of adding a wealthy house and some strong arms to\r\nthe Commonwealth, he was compelled, along with his family, to reside in\r\nFlorence for a great part of every year.\r\n\r\nWith a wider territory and an increasing commerce, it was natural for\r\nFlorence to assume more and more the attitude of a sovereign state,\r\nready, when need was, to impose its will upon its neighbours, or to join\r\nwith them for the common defence of Tuscany. In the noble class and its\r\nretainers, recruited as has been described, it was possessed of a\r\nstanding army which, whether from love of adventure or greed of plunder,\r\nwas never so well pleased as when in active employment. Not that the\r\ncommons left the fighting wholly to the men of family, for they too, at\r\nthe summons of the war-bell, had to arm for the field; but at the best\r\nthey did it from a sense of duty, and, without the aid of professional\r\nmen-at-arms, they must have failed more frequently in their enterprises,\r\nor at any rate have had to endure a greatly prolonged absence from their\r\ncounters and workshops. And yet, esteem this advantage as highly as we\r\nwill, Florence surely lost more than it gained by compelling the crowd\r\nof idle gentlemen to come within its walls. In the course of time some\r\nof them indeed condescended to engage in trade--sank, as the phrase\r\nwent, into the ranks of the _Popolani_, or mere wealthy citizens; but\r\nthe great body of them, while their landed property was being largely\r\nincreased in value in consequence of the general prosperity, held\r\nthemselves haughtily aloof from honest industry in every form. Each\r\nfamily, or rather each clan of them, lived apart in its own group of\r\nhouses, from among which towers shot aloft for scores of yards into the\r\nair, dominating the humbler dwellings of the common burghers. These,\r\nwhenever they came to the front for a time in the government, were used\r\nto decree that all private towers were to be lopped down to within a\r\ncertain distance from the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is a favourite exercise of Villani and other historians to trace the\r\ntroubles and revolutions in the state of Florence to chance quarrels\r\nbetween noble families, arising from an angry word or a broken troth.\r\nHere, they tell, was sown the seed of the Guelf and Ghibeline wars in\r\nFlorence; and here that of the feuds of Black and White. Such quarrels\r\nand party names were symptoms and nothing more. The enduring source of\r\ntrouble was the presence within the city of a powerful idle class,\r\nconstantly eager to recover the privilege it had lost, and to secure\r\nitself by every available means, including that of outside help, in the\r\npossession of what it still retained; which chafed against the curbs put\r\nupon its lawlessness, and whose ambitions were all opposed to the\r\ngeneral interest. The citizens, for their part, had nothing better to\r\nhope for than that Italy should be left to the Italians, Florence to the\r\nFlorentines. On the occasion of the celebrated Buondelmonti feud (1215),\r\nsome of the nobles definitely went over to the side of the people,\r\neither because they judged it likely to win in the long-run, or\r\nimpelled unconsciously by the forces that in every society divide\r\nambitious men into two camps, and in one form or another develop party\r\nstrife. They who made a profession of popular sympathy did it with a\r\nview of using rather than of helping the people at large. Both of the\r\nnoble parties held the same end in sight--control of the Commonwealth;\r\nand this would be worth the more the fewer there were to share it. The\r\nfaction irreconcilable with the Republic on any terms included many of\r\nthe oldest and proudest houses. Their hope lay in the advent of a strong\r\nEmperor, who should depute to them his rights over the money-getting,\r\nlow-born crowd.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity of this class might seem to have come when the\r\nHohenstaufen Frederick II., grandson of Barbarossa, ascended the throne,\r\nand still more when, on attaining full age, he claimed the whole of the\r\nPeninsula as his family inheritance. Other Emperors had withstood the\r\nPapal claims, but none had ever proved an antagonist like Frederick. His\r\nquarrel seemed indeed to be with the Church itself, with its doctrines\r\nand morals as well as with the ambition of churchmen; and he offered the\r\nstrange spectacle of a Roman Emperor--one of the twin lights in the\r\nChristian firmament--whose favour was less easily won by Christian\r\npiety, however eminent, than by the learning of the Arab or the Jew.\r\nWhen compelled at last to fulfil a promise extorted from him of\r\nconducting a crusade to the Holy Land, he scandalised Christendom by\r\nmaking friends of the Sultan, and by using his presence in the East, not\r\nfor the deliverance of the Sepulchre, but for the furtherance of\r\nlearning and commerce. Thrice excommunicated, he had his revenge by\r\nproving with how little concern the heaviest anathemas of the Church\r\ncould be met by one who was armed in unbelief. Literature, art, and\r\nmanners were sedulously cultivated in his Sicilian court, and among the\r\nable ministers whom he selected or formed, the modern idea of the State\r\nmay be said to have had its birth. Free thinker and free liver, poet,\r\nwarrior, and statesman, he stood forward against the sombre background\r\nof the Middle Ages a figure in every respect so brilliant and original\r\nas well to earn from his contemporaries the title of the Wonder of the\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nOn the goodwill of Italians Frederick had the claim of being the most\r\nItalian of all the Emperors since the revival of the Western Empire, and\r\nthe only one of them whose throne was permanently set on Italian soil.\r\nYet he never won the popular heart. To the common mind he always\r\nappeared as something outlandish and terrible--as the man who had driven\r\na profitable but impious trade in the Sultan\'s land. Dante, in his\r\nchildhood, must have heard many a tale of him; and we find him keenly\r\ninterested in the character of the Emperor who came nearest to uniting\r\nItaly into a great nation, in whose court there had been a welcome for\r\nevery man of intellect, and in whom a great original poet would have\r\nfound a willing and munificent patron. In the _Inferno_, by the mouth of\r\nPier delle Vigne, the Imperial Chancellor, he pronounces Frederick to\r\nhave been worthy of all honour;[5] yet justice requires him to lodge\r\nthis flower of kings in the burning tomb of the Epicureans, as having\r\nbeen guilty of the arch-heresy of denying the moral government of the\r\nworld, and holding that with the death of the body all is ended.[6] It\r\nwas a heresy fostered by the lives of many churchmen, high and low; but\r\nthe example of Frederick encouraged the profession of it by nobles and\r\nlearned laymen. On Frederick\'s character there was a still darker stain\r\nthan this of religious indifference--that of cold-blooded cruelty. Even\r\nin an age which had produced Ezzelino Romano, the Emperor\'s cloaks of\r\nlead were renowned as the highest refinement in torture.[7] But, with\r\nall his genius, and his want of scruple in the choice of means, he built\r\nnothing politically that was not ere his death crumbling to dust. His\r\nenduring work was that of an intellectual reformer under whose\r\nprotection and with whose personal help his native language was refined,\r\nEurope was enriched with a learning new to it or long forgotten, and the\r\nminds of men, as they lost their blind reverence for Rome, were prepared\r\nfor a freer treatment of all the questions with which religion deals. He\r\nwas thus in some respects a precursor of Dante.\r\n\r\nMore than once in the course of Frederick\'s career it seemed as if he\r\nmight become master of Tuscany in fact as well as in name, had Florence\r\nonly been as well affected to him as were Siena and Pisa. But already,\r\nas has been said, the popular interest had been strengthened by\r\naccessions from among the nobles. Others of them, without descending\r\ninto the ranks of the citizens, had set their hopes on being the first\r\nin a commonwealth rather than privates in the Imperial garrison. These\r\nmen, with their restless and narrow ambitions, were as dangerous to have\r\nfor allies as for foes, but by throwing their weight into the popular\r\nscale they at least served to hold the Imperialist magnates in check,\r\nand established something like a balance in the fighting power of\r\nFlorence; and so, as in the days of Barbarossa, the city was preserved\r\nfrom taking a side too strongly. The hearts of the Florentine traders\r\nwere in their own affairs--in extending their commerce and increasing\r\ntheir territory and influence in landward Tuscany. As regarded the\r\ngeneral politics of Italy, their sympathy was still with the Roman See;\r\nbut it was a sympathy without devotion or gratitude. For refusing to\r\njoin in the crusade of 1238 the town was placed under interdict by\r\nGregory IX. The Emperor meanwhile was acknowledged as its lawful\r\noverlord, and his vicar received something more than nominal obedience,\r\nthe choice of the chief magistrates being made subject to his approval.\r\nYet with all this, and although his party was powerful in the city, it\r\nwas but a grudging service that was yielded to Frederick. More than once\r\nfines were levied on the Florentines; and worse punishments were\r\nthreatened for their persevering and active enmity to Siena, now\r\ndominated by its nobles and held in the Imperial interest. Volunteers\r\nfrom Florence might join the Emperor in his Lombard campaigns; but they\r\nwere left equally free by the Commonwealth to join the other side. At\r\nlast, when he was growing old, and when like his grandfather he had been\r\nfoiled by the stubborn Lombards, he turned on the Florentines as an\r\neasier prey, and sent word to the nobles of his party to seize the city.\r\nFor months the streets were filled with battle. In January 1248,\r\nFrederick of Antioch, the natural son of the Emperor, entered Florence\r\nwith some squadrons of men-at-arms, and a few days later the nobles that\r\nhad fought on the popular side were driven into banishment. This is\r\nknown in the Florentine annals as the first dispersion of the Guelfs.\r\n\r\nLong before they were adopted in Italy, the names of Guelf and Ghibeline\r\nhad been employed in Germany to mark the partisans of the Bavarian Welf\r\nand of the Hohenstaufen lords of Waiblingen. On Italian soil they\r\nreceived an extended meaning: Ghibeline stood for Imperialist; Guelf for\r\nanti-Imperialist, Papalist, or simply Nationalist. When the names began\r\nto be freely used in Florence, which was towards the close of\r\nFrederick\'s reign and about a century after their first invention, they\r\ndenoted no new start in politics, but only supplied a nomenclature for\r\nparties already in existence. As far as Florence was concerned, the\r\ndesignations were the more convenient that they were not too closely\r\ndescriptive. The Ghibeline was the Emperor\'s man, when it served his\r\npurpose to be so; while the Guelf, constant only in his enmity to the\r\nGhibelines, was free to think of the Pope as he chose, and to serve him\r\nno more than he wished or needed to. Ultimately, indeed, all Florence\r\nmay be said to have become Guelf. To begin with, the name distinguished\r\nthe nobles who sought alliance with the citizens, from the nobles who\r\nlooked on these as they might have done on serfs newly thriven into\r\nwealth. Each party was to come up in turn. Within a period of twenty\r\nyears each was twice driven into banishment, a measure always\r\naccompanied with decrees of confiscation and the levelling of private\r\nstrongholds in Florence. The exiles kept well together, retreating, as\r\nit were in the order of war, to camps of observation they found ready\r\nprepared for them in the nearest cities and fortresses held by those of\r\ntheir own way of thinking. All their wits were then bent on how, by dint\r\nof some fighting and much diplomacy, they might shake the strength and\r\nundermine the credit of their successful rivals in the city, and secure\r\ntheir own return in triumph. It was an art they were proud to be adepts\r\nin.[8]\r\n\r\nIn a rapid sketch like this it would be impossible to tell half the\r\nchanges made on the constitution of Florence during the second part of\r\nthe thirteenth century. Dante in a well-known passage reproaches\r\nFlorence with the political restlessness which afflicted her like a\r\ndisease. Laws, he says, made in October were fallen into desuetude ere\r\nmid-November.[9] And yet it may be that in this constant readiness to\r\nchange, lies the best proof of the political capacity of the\r\nFlorentines. It was to meet new necessities that they made provision of\r\nnew laws. Especial watchfulness was called for against the encroachments\r\nof the grandees, whose constant tendency--whatever their party\r\nname--was to weaken legal authority, and play the part of lords and\r\nmasters of the citizens. But these were no mere weavers and\r\nquill-drivers to be plundered at will. Even before the return of the\r\nGuelfs, banished in 1248, the citizens, taking advantage of a check\r\nsuffered in the field by the dominant Ghibelines, had begun to recast\r\nthe constitution in a popular sense, and to organise the townsmen as a\r\nmilitia on a permanent footing. When, on the death of Frederick in 1250,\r\nthe Imperialist nobles were left without foreign aid, there began a\r\nperiod of ten years, favourably known in Florentine history as the\r\nGovernment of the _Primo Popolo_ or _Popolo Vecchio_; that is, of the\r\ntrue body of the citizens, commoners possessed of franchises, as\r\ndistinguished from the nobles above them and the multitude below. For it\r\nis never to be forgotten that Florence, like Athens, and like the other\r\nItalian Republics, was far from being a true democracy. The time was yet\r\nto come, and it was not far distant, when the ranks of citizenship were\r\nto be more widely opened than now to those below, and more closely shut\r\nto those above. In the meantime the comparatively small number of\r\nwealthy citizens who legally composed the \'People\' made good use of\r\ntheir ten years of breathing-time, entering on commercial treaties and\r\nwidening the possessions of the Commonwealth, now by war, and now by\r\nshrewd bargains with great barons. To balance the influence of the\r\nPodesta, who had hitherto been the one great officer of State--criminal\r\njudge, civil governor, and commander-in-chief all in one--they created\r\nthe office of Captain of the People. The office of Podesta was not\r\npeculiar to Florence. There, as in other cities, in order to secure his\r\nimpartiality, it was provided that he should be a foreigner, and hold\r\noffice only for six months. But he was also required to be of gentle\r\nbirth; and his councils were so composed that, like his own, their\r\nsympathies were usually with the nobles. The Captain of the People was\r\ntherefore created partly as a tribune for the protection of the popular\r\nrights, and partly to act as permanent head of the popular forces. Like\r\nthe Podesta, he had two councils assigned to him; but these were\r\nstrictly representative of the citizens, and sat to control his conduct\r\nas well as to lend to his action the weight of public opinion.\r\n\r\nSuch of the Ghibelines as had not been banished from Florence on the\r\ndeath of Frederick, lived there on sufferance, as it were, and under a\r\nrigid supervision. Once more they were to find a patron and ally in a\r\nmember of the great house of Hohenstaufen; and with his aid they were\r\nagain for a few years to become supreme in Florence, and to prove by\r\ntheir abuse of power how well justified was the mistrust the people had\r\nof them. In many ways Manfred, one of Frederick\'s bastards, was a worthy\r\nson of his father. Like him he was endowed with great personal charm,\r\nand was enamoured of all that opened new regions to intellectual\r\ncuriosity or gave refinement to sensual pleasure. In his public as well\r\nas in his private behaviour, he was reckless of what the Church and its\r\ndoctrines might promise or threaten; and equally so, his enemies\r\ndeclared, of the dictates of common humanity. Hostile eyes detected in\r\nthe green clothes which were his favourite dress a secret attachment to\r\nIslam; and hostile tongues charged him with the murder of a father and\r\nof a brother, and the attempted murder of a nephew. His ambition did not\r\naim at the Empire, but only at being King of Sicily and Naples, lands\r\nwhich the Hohenstaufens claimed as their own through the Norman mother\r\nof Frederick. Of these kingdoms he was actual ruler, even while his\r\nlegitimate brother Conrad lived. On the death of that prince he brushed\r\naside the claims of Conradin, his nephew, and bid boldly for recognition\r\nby the Pope, who claimed to be overlord of the southern kingdoms--a\r\nrecognition refused, or given only to be immediately withdrawn. In the\r\neyes of Rome he was no more than Prince of Tarentum, but by arms and\r\npolicy he won what seemed a firm footing in the South; and eight years\r\nafter the rule of the _Popolo Vecchio_ began in Florence he was the\r\nacknowledged patron of all in Italy who had been Imperialist--for the\r\nImperial throne was now practically vacant. And Manfred was trusted all\r\nthe more that he cared nothing for Germany, and stood out even more\r\npurely an Italian monarch than his father had ever been. The Ghibelines\r\nof Florence looked to him to free them of the yoke under which they\r\ngroaned.\r\n\r\nWhen it was discovered that they were treating with Manfred, there was\r\nan outburst of popular wrath against the disaffected nobles. Some of\r\nthem were seized and put to death, a fate shared by the Abbot of\r\nVallombrosa, whom neither his priestly office nor his rank as Papal\r\nLegate availed to save from torture and a shameful end.[10] Well\r\naccustomed as was the age to violence and cruelty, it was shocked at\r\nthis free disposal of a great ecclesiastic by a mercantile community;\r\nand even to the Guelf chronicler Villani the terrible defeat of\r\nMontaperti seemed no more than a just vengeance taken by Heaven upon a\r\ncrime so heinous.[11] In the meantime the city was laid under interdict,\r\nand those concerned in the Abbot\'s death were excommunicated; while the\r\nGhibelines, taking refuge in Siena, began to plot and scheme with the\r\ngreater spirit against foes who, in the very face of a grave peril, had\r\noffended in the Pope their strongest natural ally.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the exiles was Farinata, one of the Uberti, a family\r\nwhich, so long ago as 1180, had raised a civil war to force their way\r\ninto the consulship. Ever since, they had been the most powerful,\r\nperhaps, and certainly the most restless, clan in Florence, rich in men\r\nof strong character, fiercely tenacious of their purpose. Such was\r\nFarinata. To the Florentines of a later age he was to stand for the type\r\nof the great Ghibeline gentleman, haughty as Lucifer, a Christian in\r\nname though scarcely by profession, and yet almost beloved for his frank\r\nexcess of pride. It detracted nothing from the grandeur of his\r\ncharacter, in the judgment of his countrymen, that he could be cunning\r\nas well as brave. Manfred was coy to afford help to the Tuscan\r\nGhibelines, standing out for an exorbitant price for the loan of his\r\nmen-at-arms; and to Farinata was attributed the device by which his\r\npoint of honour was effectually touched.[12] When at last a\r\nreinforcement of eight hundred cavalry entered Siena, the exiles and\r\ntheir allies felt themselves more than a match for the militia of\r\nFlorence, and set themselves to decoy it into the field. Earlier in the\r\nsame year the Florentines had encamped before Siena, and sought in vain\r\nto bring on a general engagement. They were now misled by false\r\nmessengers, primed by Farinata, into a belief that the Sienese, weary of\r\nthe arrogance of Provenzano Salvani,[13] then all-powerful in Siena,\r\nwere ready to betray a gate to them. In vain did Tegghiaio\r\nAldobrandi,[14] one of the Guelf nobles, counsel delay till the German\r\nmen-at-arms, wearied with waiting on and perhaps dissatisfied with their\r\nwages, should be recalled by Manfred. A march in full strength upon the\r\nhostile city was resolved on by the eager townsmen.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Montaperti was fought in September 1260, among the earthy\r\nhills washed by the Arbia and its tributary rivulets, a few miles to the\r\neast of Siena. It marked the close of the rule of the _Popolo Vecchio_.\r\nTill then no such disastrous day had come to Florence; and the defeat\r\nwas all the more intolerable that it was counted for a victory to Siena.\r\nYet the battle was far from being a test of the strength of the two\r\nrival cities. Out of the thirty thousand foot in the Guelf army, there\r\nwere only about five thousand Florentines. In the host which poured out\r\non them from Siena, beside the militia of that city and the Florentine\r\nexiles, were included the Ghibelines of Arezzo, the retainers of great\r\nlords still unsubdued by any city, and, above all, the German\r\nmen-at-arms of Manfred.[15] But the worst enemies of Florence were the\r\ntraitors in her own ranks. She bore it long in mind that it was her\r\nmerchants and handicraftsmen who stood stubbornly at bay, and tinged the\r\nArbia red with their life-blood; while it was among the men of high\r\ndegree that the traitors were found. On one of them, Bocca degli Abati,\r\nwho struck off the right hand of the standard-bearer of the cavalry, and\r\nso helped on the confusion and the rout, Dante takes vengeance in his\r\npitiless verse.[16]\r\n\r\nThe fortifications of Florence had been recently completed and\r\nstrengthened, and it was capable of a long defence. But the spirit of\r\nthe people was broken for the time, and the conquerors found the gates\r\nopen. Then it was that Farinata almost atoned for any wrong he ever did\r\nhis native town, by withstanding a proposal made by the Ghibelines of\r\nthe rival Tuscan cities, that Florence should be destroyed, and Empoli\r\nadvanced to fill her room. \'Alone, with open face I defended her,\' Dante\r\nmakes him say.[17] But the wonder would rather be if he had voted to\r\ndestroy a city of which he was about to be one of the tyrants. Florence\r\nhad now a fuller experience than ever of the oppression which it was in\r\nthe character of the Ghibelines to exercise. A rich booty lay ready to\r\ntheir hands; for in the panic after Montaperti crowds of the best in\r\nFlorence had fled, leaving all behind them except their wives and\r\nchildren, whom they would not trust to the cruel mercy of the victors.\r\nIt was in this exile that for the first time the industrious citizen was\r\nassociated with the Guelf noble. From Lucca, not powerful enough to\r\ngrant them protection for long, they were driven to Bologna, suffering\r\nterribly on the passage of the Apennines from cold and want of food, but\r\nsafe when the mountains lay between them and the Val d\'Arno. While the\r\nnobles and young men with a taste for fighting found their livelihood in\r\nservice against the Lombard Ghibelines, the more sober-minded scattered\r\nthemselves to seek out their commercial correspondents and increase\r\ntheir acquaintance with the markets of Europe. When at length the way\r\nwas open for them to return home, they came back educated by travel, as\r\nmen must always be who travel for a purpose; and from this second exile\r\nof the Guelfs dates a vast extension of the commerce of Florence.\r\n\r\nTheir return was a fruit of the policy followed by the Papal Court The\r\ninterests of both were the same. The Roman See could have as little\r\nindependence of action while a hostile monarch was possessed of the\r\nsouthern kingdoms, as the people of Florence could have freedom while\r\nthe Ghibeline nobility had for patron a military prince, to whom their\r\ngates lay open by way of Siena and Pisa. To Sicily and Naples the Pope\r\nlaid claim by an alternative title--they were either dependent on the\r\nSee of Rome, or, if they were Imperial fiefs, then, in the vacancy of\r\nthe Empire, the Pope, as the only head of Christendom, had a right to\r\ndispose of them as he would. A champion was needed to maintain the\r\nclaim, and at length the man was found in Charles of Anjou, brother of\r\nSt. Louis. This was a prince of intellectual powers far beyond the\r\ncommon, of untiring industry in affairs, pious, \'chaste as a monk,\' and\r\ncold-hearted as a usurer; gifted with all the qualities, in short, that\r\nmake a man feared and well served, and with none that make him beloved.\r\nHe was not one to risk failure for want of deliberation and foresight,\r\nand his measures were taken with such prudence that by the time he\r\nlanded in Italy his victory was almost assured. He found his enemy at\r\nBenevento, in the Neapolitan territory (February 1266). In order to get\r\ntime for reinforcements to come up, Manfred sought to enter into\r\nnegotiations; but Charles was ready, and knew his advantage. He answered\r\nwith the splendid confidence of a man sure of a heavenly if he missed\r\nan earthly triumph. \'Go tell the Sultan of Lucera,\'[18] was his reply,\r\n\'that to-day I shall send him to Hell, or he will send me to Paradise.\'\r\nManfred was slain, and his body, discovered only after long search, was\r\ndenied Christian burial. Yet, excommunicated though he was, and\r\nsuspected of being at heart as much Mohammedan as Christian, he, as well\r\nas his great rival, is found by Dante in Purgatory.[19] And, while the\r\nChristian poet pours his invective on the pious Charles,[20] he is at no\r\npains to hide how pitiful appeared to him the fate of the frank and\r\nhandsome Manfred, all whose followers adored him. He, as more than once\r\nit happens in the _Comedy_ to those whose memory is dear to the poet, is\r\nsaved from Inferno by the fiction that in the hour of death he sent one\r\nthought heavenward--\'so wide is the embrace of infinite mercy.\'[21]\r\n\r\nTo Florence Charles proved a useful if a greedy and exacting protector.\r\nUnder his influence as Pacificator of Tuscany--an office created for him\r\nby the Pope--the Guelfs were enabled slowly to return from exile, and\r\nthe Ghibelines were gradually depressed into a condition of dependence\r\non the goodwill of the citizens over whom they had so lately domineered.\r\nHenceforth failure attended every effort they made to lift their heads.\r\nThe stubbornly irreconcilable were banished or put to death. Elaborate\r\nprovisions were enacted in obedience to the Pope\'s commands, by which\r\nthe rest were to be at peace with their old foes. Now they were to live\r\nin the city, but under disabilities as regarded eligibility to offices;\r\nnow they were to be represented in the public councils, but so as to be\r\nalways in a minority. The result of the measures taken, and of the\r\nnatural drift of things, was that ere many more years had passed there\r\nwere no avowed Ghibelines in Florence.\r\n\r\nOne influence constantly at work in this direction was that of the\r\n_Parte Guelfa_, a Florentine society formed to guard the interests of\r\nthe Guelfs, and which was possessed of the greater part of the Ghibeline\r\nproperty confiscated after the triumph of Charles had turned the balance\r\nof power in Italy. This organisation has been well described as a state\r\nwithin a state, and it seems as if the part it played in the Florentine\r\npolitics of this period were not yet fully known. This much seems sure,\r\nthat the members of the Society were mostly Guelf nobles; that its\r\npower, derived from the administration of vast wealth to a political\r\nend, was so great that the Captain of the _Parte Guelfa_ held a place\r\nalmost on a level with that of the chief officials of the Commonwealth;\r\nand that it made loans of ready money to Florence and the Pope, on\r\ncondition of their being used to the damage of the Ghibelines.[22]\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth, busy in resettling its government, was but slightly\r\ninterested in much that went on around it. The boy Conradin, grandson of\r\nFrederick, nephew of Manfred, and in a sense the last of the\r\nHohenstaufens, came to Italy to measure himself with Charles, and paid\r\nfor his audacity upon the scaffold.[23] Charles deputed Guy of Montfort,\r\nson of the great Earl Simon, to be his vicar in Florence. The Pope\r\nsmiled and frowned in turn on the Florentines, as their devotion to him\r\nwaxed and waned; and so he did on his champion Charles, whose ambition\r\nwas apt to outrun his piety. All this was of less importance to the\r\nCommonwealth than the promotion of its domestic interests. It saw with\r\nequanimity a check given to Charles by the election of a new Emperor in\r\nRudolf of Hapsburg (1273), and a further check by the Sicilian Vespers,\r\nwhich lost him half his kingdom (1283). But Siena and Pisa, Arezzo, and\r\neven Pistoia, were the objects of a sleepless anxiety. Pisa was the\r\nchief source of danger, being both from sentiment and interest\r\nstubbornly Ghibeline. When at length its power was broken by Genoa, its\r\ngreat maritime rival, in the naval battle of Meloria (1284), there was\r\nno longer any city in Tuscany to be compared for wealth and strength\r\nwith Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that Dante, reaching the age of manhood, began to\r\nperform the duties that fell to him as a youthful citizen--duties which,\r\ntill the age of thirty was reached, were chiefly those of military\r\nservice. The family to which he belonged was a branch of the Elisei,\r\nwho are included by Villani in the earliest catalogue given by him of\r\nthe great Florentine houses. Cacciaguida, one of the Elisei, born in\r\n1106, married a daughter of the Aldighieri, a family of Ferrara. Their\r\nson was christened Aldighiero, and this was adopted by the family as a\r\nsurname, afterwards changed to Alighieri. The son of Aldighiero was\r\nBellincione, father of Aldighiero II., the father of Dante.\r\n\r\nIt serves no purpose to fill a page of biography with genealogical\r\ndetails when the hero\'s course in life was in no way affected by the\r\naccident of who was his grandfather. In the case of Dante, his position\r\nin the State, his political creed, and his whole fashion of regarding\r\nlife, were vitally influenced by the circumstances of his birth. He knew\r\nthat his genius, and his genius alone, was to procure him fame; he\r\ndeclares a virtuous and gentle life to be the true proof of nobility:\r\nand yet his family pride is always breaking through. In real life, from\r\nhis family\'s being decayed in wealth and fallen in consideration\r\ncompared with its neighbours, he may have been led to put emphasis on\r\nhis assertion of gentility; and amid the poverty and humiliations of his\r\nexile he may have found a tonic in the thought that by birth, not to\r\nspeak of other things, he was the equal of those who spurned him or\r\ncoldly lent him aid. However this may be, there is a tacit claim of\r\nequality with them in the easy grace with which he encounters great\r\nnobles in the world of shades. The bent of his mind in relation to this\r\nsubject is shown by such a touch as that when he esteems it among the\r\nglories of Francis of Assisi not to have been ashamed of his base\r\nextraction.[24] In Paradise he meets his great crusading ancestor\r\nCacciaguida, and feigns contrition for the pleasure with which he\r\nlistens to a declaration of the unmixed purity of their common\r\nblood.[25] In Inferno he catches a glimpse, sudden and terrible, of a\r\nkinsman whose violent death had remained unavenged; and, for the nonce,\r\nthe philosopher-poet is nothing but the member of an injured Florentine\r\nclan, and winces at the thought of a neglected blood feud.[26] And when\r\nFarinata, the great Ghibeline, and haughtiest of all the Florentines of\r\nthe past generation, asks him, \'Who were thine ancestors?\' Dante says\r\nwith a proud pretence of humility, \'Anxious to obey, I hid nothing, but\r\ntold him all he demanded.\'[27]\r\n\r\nDante was born in Florence in the May of 1265.[28] A brother of his\r\nfather had been one of the guards of the Florentine Caroccio, or\r\nstandard-bearing car, at the battle of Montaperti (1260). Whether\r\nDante\'s father necessarily shared in the exile of his party may be\r\ndoubted. He is said--on slight authority--to have been a jurisconsult:\r\nthere is no reason to suppose he was at Montaperti. It is difficult to\r\nbelieve that Florence was quite emptied of its lawyers and merchants as\r\na consequence of the Ghibeline victory. In any case, it is certain that\r\nwhile the fugitive Guelfs were mostly accompanied by their wives, and\r\ndid not return till 1267, we have Dante\'s own word for it that he was\r\nborn in the great city by the Arno,[29] and was baptized in the\r\nBaptistery, his beautiful St. John\'s.[30] At the font he received the\r\nname of Durante, shortened, as he bore it, into Dante. It is in this\r\nform that it finds a place in the _Comedy_,[31] once, and only once,\r\nwritten down of necessity, the poet says--the necessity of being\r\nfaithful in the report of Beatrice\'s words: from the wider necessity, we\r\nmay assume, of imbedding in the work itself the name by which the author\r\nwas commonly known, and by which he desired to be called for all time.\r\n\r\nWhen Dante was about ten years old he lost his father. Of his mother\r\nnothing but her Christian name of Bella is known. Neither of them is\r\nmentioned in the _Comedy_,[32] nor indeed are his wife and children.\r\nBoccaccio describes the Alighieri as having been in easy though not in\r\nwealthy circumstances; and Leonardo Bruni, who in the fifteenth century\r\nsought out what he could learn of Dante, says of him that he was\r\npossessed of a patrimony sufficient for an honourable livelihood. That\r\nhe was so might be inferred from the character of the education he\r\nreceived. His studies, says Boccaccio, were not directed to any object\r\nof worldly profit. That there is no sign of their having been directed\r\nby churchmen tends to prove the existence in his native town of a class\r\nof cultivated laymen; and that there was such appears from the ease\r\nwith which, when, passing from boyhood to manhood, he felt a craving for\r\nintellectual and congenial society, he found in nobles of the stamp of\r\nGuido Cavalcanti men like-minded with himself. It was indeed impossible\r\nbut that the revival of the study of the civil law, the importation of\r\nnew learning from the East, and the sceptical spirit fostered in Italy\r\nby the influence of Frederick II. and his court, should all have told on\r\nthe keen-witted Florentines, of whom a great proportion--even of the\r\ncommon people--could read; while the class with leisure had every\r\nopportunity of knowing what was going on in the world.[33] Heresy, the\r\nrough word for intellectual life as well as for religious aspiration,\r\nhad found in Florence a congenial soil.[34] In the thirteenth century,\r\nwhich modern ignorance loves to reckon as having been in a special sense\r\nan age of faith, there were many Florentines who, in spite of their\r\noutward conformity, had drifted as far from spiritual allegiance to the\r\nChurch as the furthest point reached by any of their descendants who\r\nsome two ages later belonged to the school of Florentine Platonists.\r\n\r\nChief among these free-thinkers, and, sooth to say, free-livers--though\r\nin this respect they were less distinguished from the orthodox--was\r\nBrunetto Latini, for some time Secretary to the Republic, and the\r\nforemost Italian man of letters of his day. Meagre though his greatest\r\nwork, the _Tesoro_, or _Treasure_, must seem to any one who now glances\r\nover its pages, to his contemporaries it answered the promise of its\r\ntitle and stood for a magazine of almost complete information in the\r\ndomains of natural history, ethics, and politics. It was written in\r\nFrench, as being a more agreeable language than Italian; and was\r\ncomposed, there is reason to believe, while Latini lived in Paris as an\r\nexiled Guelf after Montaperti. His _Tesoretto_, or _Little Treasure_, a\r\npoem in jingling eight-syllabled Italian verse, has been thought by some\r\nto have supplied hints to Dante for the _Comedy_.[35] By neither of\r\nthese works is he evinced a man of strong intellect, or even of good\r\ntaste. Yet there is the testimony of Villani that he did much to refine\r\nthe language of his contemporaries, and to apply fixed principles to the\r\nconduct of State affairs.[36] Dante meets him in Inferno, and hails him\r\nas his intellectual father--as the master who taught him from day to day\r\nhow fame is to be won.[37] But it is too much to infer from these words\r\nthat Latini served as his teacher, in the common sense of the word. It\r\nis true they imply an intimacy between the veteran scholar and his\r\nyoung townsman; but the closeness of their intercourse is perhaps best\r\naccounted for by supposing that Latini had been acquainted with Dante\'s\r\nfather, and by the great promise of Dante\'s boyhood was led to take a\r\nwarm interest in his intellectual development. Their intimacy, to judge\r\nfrom the tone of their conversation down in Inferno, had lasted till\r\nLatini\'s death. But no tender reminiscence of the days they spent\r\ntogether avails to save him from condemnation at the hands of his severe\r\ndisciple. By the manners of Brunetto, and the Epicurean heresies of\r\nothers of his friends, Dante, we may be sure, was never infected or\r\ndefiled.\r\n\r\nDante describes himself as having begun the serious study of philosophy\r\nand theology only at the mature age of twenty-seven. But ere that time\r\nhe had studied to good effect, and not books alone, but the world around\r\nhim too, and the world within. The poet was formed before the theologian\r\nand philosopher. From his earliest years he was used to write in verse;\r\nand he seems to have esteemed as one of his best endowments the easy\r\ncommand of his mother tongue acquired by him while still in boyhood.\r\n\r\nOf the poems written in his youth he made a selection, and with a\r\ncommentary gave them to the world as his first work.[38] All the sonnets\r\nand canzoni contained in it bear more or less directly on his love for\r\nBeatrice Portinari. This lady, whose name is so indissolubly associated\r\nwith that of Dante, was the daughter of a rich citizen of good family.\r\nWhen Dante saw her first he was a child of nine, and she a few months\r\nyounger. It would seem fabulous, he says, if he related what things he\r\ndid, and of what a passion he was the victim during his boyhood. He\r\nseized opportunities of beholding her, but for long never passed beyond\r\na silent worship; and he was eighteen before she spoke to him, and then\r\nonly in the way of a passing salutation. On this he had a vision, and\r\nthat inspired him with a sonnet, certainly not the first he had written,\r\nbut the first he put into circulation. The mode of publication he\r\nadopted was the common one of sending copies of it to such other poets\r\nas were within reach. The sonnet in itself contains a challenge to\r\ninterpret his dream. Several poets attempted the riddle--among them the\r\nphilosopher and poet Guido Cavalcanti. They all failed in the solution;\r\nbut with some of them he was thus brought into terms of intimacy, and\r\nwith Cavalcanti of the closest friendship. Some new grace of style in\r\nDante\'s verse, some art in the presentation of his mystical meaning that\r\nescapes the modern reader, may have revealed to the middle-aged man of\r\nletters that a new genius had arisen. It was by Guido\'s advice that the\r\npoems of which this sonnet stands the first were some years later\r\ncollected and published with the explanatory narrative. To him, in a\r\nsense, the whole work is addressed; and it agreed with his taste, as\r\nwell as Dante\'s own, that it should contain nothing but what was written\r\nin the vulgar tongue. Others besides Guido must have recognised in the\r\nlittle book, as it passed from hand to hand, the masterpiece of Italian\r\nprose, as well as of Italian verse. In the simple title of _Vita Nuova_,\r\nor _The New Life_,[39] we can fancy that a claim is laid to originality\r\nof both subject and treatment. Through the body of the work, though not\r\nso clearly as in the _Comedy_, there rings the note of assurance of\r\nsafety from present neglect and future oblivion.\r\n\r\nIt may be owing to the free use of personification and symbol in the\r\n_Vita Nuova_ that some critics, while not denying the existence of a\r\nreal Beatrice, have held that she is introduced only to help out an\r\nallegory, and that, under the veil of love for her, the poet would\r\nexpress his youthful passion for truth. Others, going to the opposite\r\nextreme, are found wondering why he never sought, or, seeking, failed to\r\nwin, the hand of Beatrice. To those who would refine the Beatrice of the\r\nearly work into a being as purely allegorical as she of the _Comedy_, it\r\nmay be conceded that the _Vita Nuova_ is not so much the history of a\r\nfirst love as of the new emotional and intellectual life to which a\r\nfirst love, as Dante experienced it, opens the door. Out of the\r\nincidents of their intercourse he chooses only such as serve for motives\r\nto the joys and sorrows of the passionate aspiring soul. On the other\r\nhand, they who seek reasons why Dante did not marry Beatrice have this\r\nto justify their curiosity, that she did marry another man. But her\r\nhusband was one of the rich and powerful Bardi; and her father was so\r\nwealthy that after providing for his children he could endow a hospital\r\nin Florence. The marriage was doubtless arranged as a matter of family\r\nconvenience, due regard being had to her dower and her husband\'s\r\nfortune; and we may assume that when Dante, too, was married later on,\r\nhis wife was found for him by the good offices of his friends.[40] Our\r\nmanners as regards these things are not those of the Italy of the\r\nthirteenth century. It may safely be said that Dante never dreamed of\r\nBeatrice for his wife; that the expectation of wedding her would have\r\nsealed his lips from uttering to the world any word of his love; and\r\nthat she would have lost something in his esteem if, out of love for\r\nhim, she had refused the man her father chose for her.\r\n\r\nWe must not seek in the _Vita Nuova_ what it does not profess to give.\r\nThere was a real Beatrice Portinari, to a careless glance perhaps not\r\ndiffering much from other Florentine ladies of her age and condition;\r\nbut her we do not find in Dante\'s pages. These are devoted to a record\r\nof the dreams and visions, the new thoughts and feelings of which she\r\nwas the occasion or the object. He worshipped at a distance, and in a\r\nsingle glance found reward enough for months of adoration; he read all\r\nheaven into a smile. So high strung is the narrative, that did we come\r\non any hint of loving dalliance it would jar with all the rest She is\r\nalways at a distance from him, less a woman than an angel.\r\n\r\nIn all this there is certainly as much of reticence as of exaggeration.\r\nWhen he comes to speak of her death he uses a phrase on which it would\r\nseem as if too little value had been set. He cannot dwell on the\r\ncircumstances of her departure, he says, without being his own\r\npanegyrist. Taken along with some other expressions in the _Vita Nuova_,\r\nand the tone of her words to him when they meet in the Earthly Paradise,\r\nwe may gather from this that not only was she aware of his long\r\ndevotion, but that, ere she died, he had been given to understand how\r\nhighly she rated it. And on the occasion of her death, one described as\r\nbeing her nearest relative by blood and, after Cavalcanti, Dante\'s chief\r\nfriend--her brother, no doubt--came to him and begged him to write\r\nsomething concerning her. It would be strange indeed if they had never\r\nlooked frankly into one another\'s faces; and yet, for anything that is\r\ndirectly told in the _Vita Nuova_, they never did.\r\n\r\nThe chief value of the _Vita Nuova_ is therefore psychological. It is a\r\nmine of materials illustrative of the author\'s mental and emotional\r\ndevelopment, but as regards historical details it is wanting in fulness\r\nand precision. Yet, even in such a sketch of Dante\'s life as this tries\r\nto be, it is necessary to dwell on the turning-points of the narrative\r\ncontained in the _Vita Nuova_; the reader always remembering that on one\r\nside Dante says more than the fact that so he may glorify his love, and\r\nless on another that he may not fail in consideration for Beatrice. She\r\nis first a maiden whom no public breath is to disturb in her virgin\r\ncalm; and afterwards a chaste wife, whose lover is as jealous of her\r\nreputation as any husband could be. The youthful lover had begun by\r\npropounding the riddle of his love so obscurely that even by his\r\nfellow-poets it had been found insoluble, adepts though they themselves\r\nwere in the art of smothering a thought. Then, though all his longing is\r\nfor Beatrice, lest she become the subject of common talk he feigns that\r\nhe is in love first with one lady and then with another.[41] He even\r\npushes his deceit so far that she rebukes him for his fickleness to one\r\nof his sham loves by denying him the customary salutation when they\r\nmeet--this salutation being the only sign of friendship she has ever\r\nshown. It is already some few years since the first sonnet was written.\r\nNow, in a ballad containing a more direct avowal of his love than he has\r\nyet ventured on,[42] he protests that it was always Beatrice his heart\r\nwas busy with, and that to her, though his eyes may have seemed to\r\nwander, his affection was always true. In the very next poem we find him\r\nas if debating with himself whether he shall persevere. He weighs the\r\nennobling influence of a pure love and the sweetness it gives to life,\r\nagainst the pains and self-denial to which it condemns its servant.\r\nHere, he tells us in his commentary, he was like a traveller who has\r\ncome to where the ways divide. His only means of escape--and he feels it\r\nis a poor one--is to throw himself into the arms of Pity.\r\n\r\nFrom internal evidence it seems reasonably certain that the marriage of\r\nBeatrice fell at the time when he describes himself as standing at the\r\nparting of the ways. Before that he has been careful to write of his\r\nlove in terms so general as to be understood only by those in possession\r\nof the key. Now he makes direct mention of her, and seeks to be in her\r\ncompany; and he even leads us to infer that it was owing to his poems\r\nthat she became a well-known personage in the streets of Florence.\r\nImmediately after the sonnet in which he has recourse to Pity, he tells\r\nhow he was led by a friend into the house of a lady, married only that\r\nday, whom they find surrounded by her lady friends, met to celebrate her\r\nhome-coming after marriage. It was the fashion for young gentlemen to\r\noffer their services at such a feast. On this occasion Dante for one can\r\ngive no help. A sudden trembling seizes him; he leans for support\r\nagainst the painted wall of the chamber; then, lifting his eyes to see\r\nif the ladies have remarked his plight, he is troubled at beholding\r\nBeatrice among them, with a smile on her lips, as, leaning towards her,\r\nthey mock at her lover\'s weakness. To his friend, who, as he leads him\r\nfrom the chamber, asks what ails him, he replies: \'My feet have reached\r\nthat point beyond which if they pass they can never return.\' It was only\r\nmatrons that gathered round a bride at her home-coming; Beatrice was\r\ntherefore by this time a married woman. That she was but newly married\r\nwe may infer from Dante\'s confusion on finding her there.[43] His secret\r\nhas now been discovered, and he must either renounce his love, or, as he\r\nis at length free to do, Beatrice being married, declare it openly, and\r\nspend his life in loyal devotion to her as the mistress of his\r\nimagination and of his heart.[44]\r\n\r\nBut how is he to pursue his devotion to her, and make use of his new\r\nprivilege of freer intercourse, when the very sight of her so unmans\r\nhim? He writes three sonnets explaining what may seem pusillanimity in\r\nhim, and resolves to write no more. Now comes the most fruitful episode\r\nin the history. Questioned by a bevy of fair ladies what is the end of a\r\nlove like his, that cannot even face the object of its desire, he\r\nanswers that his happiness lies in the words by which he shows forth the\r\npraises of his mistress. He has now discovered that his passion is its\r\nown reward. In other words, he has succeeded in spiritualising his love;\r\nalthough to a careless reader it might seem in little need of passing\r\nthrough the process. Then, soon after, as he walks by a crystal brook,\r\nhe is inspired with the words which begin the noblest poem he had yet\r\nproduced,[45] and that as the author of which he is hailed by a\r\nfellow-poet in Purgatory. It is the first to glorify Beatrice as one in\r\nwhom Heaven is more concerned than Earth; and in it, too, he anticipates\r\nhis journey through the other world. She dies,[46] and we are surprised\r\nto find that within a year of her death he wavers in his allegiance to\r\nher memory. A fair face, expressing a tender compassion, looks down on\r\nhim from a window as he goes nursing his great sorrow; and he loves the\r\nowner of the face because she pities him. But seeing Beatrice in a\r\nvision he is restored, and the closing sonnet tells how his whole desire\r\ngoes forth to her, and how his spirit is borne above the highest sphere\r\nto behold her receiving honour, and shedding radiance on all around her.\r\nThe narrative closes with a reference to a vision which he does not\r\nrecount, but which incites him to severe study in order that he may\r\nlearn to write of her as she deserves. And the last sentence of the\r\n_Vita Nuova_ expresses a hope--a hope which would be arrogant coming\r\nafter anything less perfect than the _Vita Nuova_--that, concerning her,\r\nhe shall yet say things never said before of any woman. Thus the poet\'s\r\nearliest work contains an earnest of the latest, and his morning makes\r\none day with his evening.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the _Vita Nuova_ is fluent and graceful, in this\r\ncontrasting strongly with the analytical arguments attached to the\r\nvarious poems. Dante treats his readers as if they were able to catch\r\nthe meaning of the most recondite allegory, and yet were ignorant of the\r\nalphabet of literary form. And, as is the case with other poets of the\r\ntime, the free movement of his fancy is often hampered by the necessity\r\nhe felt of expressing himself in the language of the popular scholastic\r\nphilosophy. All this is but to say that he was a man of his period, as\r\nwell as a great genius. And even in this his first work he bettered the\r\nexample of Guido Cavalcanti, Guido of Bologna, and the others whom he\r\nfound, but did not long suffer to remain, the masters of Italian\r\nverse.[47] These inherited from the Proven\xc3\xa7al and Sicilian poets much\r\nof the cant of which European poetry has been so slow to clear itself;\r\nand chiefly that of presenting all human emotion and volition under the\r\nfigure of love for a mistress, who was often merely a creature of fancy,\r\nset up to act as Queen of Beauty while the poet ran his intellectual\r\njousts. But Dante dealt in no feigned inspiration, and distinguishes\r\nhimself from the whole school of philosophical and artificial poets as\r\n\'one who can only speak as love inspires.\'[48] He may deal in allegory\r\nand utter sayings dark enough, but the first suggestions of his thoughts\r\nare obtained from facts of emotion or of real life. His lady was no\r\ncreature of fancy, but his neighbour Beatrice Portinari: and she who\r\nends in the _Paradiso_ as the embodied beauty of holiness was, to begin\r\nwith, a fair Florentine girl.\r\n\r\nThe instance of Beatrice is the strongest, although others might be\r\nadduced, to illustrate Dante\'s economy of actual experience; the skilful\r\nuse, that is, of real emotions and incidents to serve for suggestion and\r\nmaterial of poetical thought. As has been told, towards the close of the\r\n_Vita Nuova_ he describes how he found a temporary consolation for the\r\nloss of Beatrice in the pity of a fair and noble lady. In his next work,\r\nthe _Convito_, or _Banquet_, she appears as the personification of\r\nphilosophy. The plan of the _Convito_ is that of a commentary on odes\r\nwhich are interpreted as having various meanings--among others the\r\nliteral as distinguished from the allegorical or essentially true. As\r\nfar as this lady is concerned, Dante shows some eagerness to pass from\r\nthe literal meaning; desirous, it may be, to correct the belief that he\r\nhad ever wavered in his exclusive devotion to Beatrice. That for a time\r\nhe did transfer his thoughts from Beatrice in Heaven to the fair lady of\r\nthe window is almost certain, and by the time he wrote the _Purgatorio_\r\nhe was able to make confession of such a fault. But at the earlier\r\nperiod at which the _Convito_[49] was written, he may have come to\r\nregard the avowal in the _Vita Nuova_ as an oversight dishonouring to\r\nhimself as well as to his first love, and so have slurred it over,\r\nleaving the fact to stand enveloped in an allegory. At any rate, to his\r\ngloss upon this passage in his life we are indebted for an interesting\r\naccount of how, at the age of twenty-seven, he put himself to school:--\r\n\r\n    \'After losing the earliest joy of my life, I was so smitten with\r\n    sorrow that in nothing could I find any comfort. Yet after some\r\n    time my mind, eager to recover its tone, since nought that I or\r\n    others could do availed to restore me, directed itself to find how\r\n    people, being disconsolate, had been comforted. And so I took to\r\n    reading that little-known book by Boethius, by writing which he,\r\n    captive and in exile, had obtained relief. Next, hearing that Tully\r\n    as well had written a book in which, treating of friendship, he had\r\n    consoled the worthy Laelius on the occasion of the loss of his\r\n    friend Scipio, I read that too. And though at the first I found\r\n    their meaning hard, at last I comprehended it as far as my\r\n    knowledge of the language and some little command of mother-wit\r\n    enabled me to do: which same mother-wit had already helped me to\r\n    much, as may be seen by the _Vita Nuova_. And as it often happens\r\n    that a man goes seeking silver, and lights on gold he is not\r\n    looking for--the result of chance, or of some divine provision; so\r\n    I, besides finding the consolation I was in search of to dry my\r\n    tears, became possessed of wisdom from authors and sciences and\r\n    books. Weighing this well, I deemed that philosophy, the mistress\r\n    of these authors, sciences, and books, must be the best of all\r\n    things. And imagining her to myself fashioned like a great lady,\r\n    rich in compassion, my admiration of her was so unbounded that I\r\n    was always delighting myself in her image. And from thus beholding\r\n    her in fancy I went on to frequent the places where she is to be\r\n    found in very deed--in the schools of theology, to wit, and the\r\n    debates of philosophers. So that in a little time, thirty months or\r\n    so, I began to taste so much of her sweetness that the love I bore\r\n    to her effaced or banished every other thought.\'[50]\r\n\r\nNo one would guess from this description of how he grew enamoured of\r\nphilosophy, that at the beginning of his arduous studies Dante took a\r\nwife. She was Gemma, the daughter of Manetto Donati, but related only\r\ndistantly, if at all, to the great Corso Donati. They were married in\r\n1292, he being twenty-seven; and in the course of the nine years that\r\nelapsed till his exile she bore him five sons and two daughters.[51]\r\nFrom his silence regarding her in his works, and from some words of\r\nBoccaccio\'s which apply only to the period of his exile, it has been\r\ninferred that the union was unhappy. But Dante makes no mention in his\r\nwritings of his parents or children any more than of Gemma.[52] And why\r\nshould not his wife be included among the things dearest to him which,\r\nhe tells us, he had to leave behind him on his banishment? For anything\r\nwe know to the contrary, their wedded life up to the time of his exile\r\nmay have been happy enough; although most probably the marriage was one\r\nof convenience, and almost certainly Dante found little in Gemma\'s mind\r\nthat answered to his own.[53] In any case it is not safe to lay stress\r\nupon his silence. During the period covered by the _Vita Nuova_ he\r\nserved more than once in the field, and to this none of his earlier\r\nworks make any reference. In 1289, Arezzo having warmly espoused the\r\nGhibeline cause, the Florentines, led by Corso Donati and the great\r\nmerchant Vieri dei Cerchi, took up arms and met the foe in the field of\r\nCampaldino, on the edge of the upland region of the Casentino. Dante, as\r\na young man of means and family, fought in the vanguard;[54] and in a\r\nletter partly preserved by one of his early biographers[55] he describes\r\nhimself as being then no tiro in arms, and as having with varying\r\nemotions watched the fortunes of the day. From this it is clear that he\r\nhad served before, probably in an expedition into the Aretine territory\r\nmade in the previous year, and referred to in the _Inferno_.[56] In the\r\nsame year as Campaldino was won he was present at the surrender of\r\nCaprona, a fortress belonging to Pisa.[57] But of all this he is silent\r\nin his works, or only makes casual mention of it by way of illustration.\r\nIt is, therefore, a waste of time trying to prove his domestic misery\r\nfrom his silence about his marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nSo hard a student was Dante that he now for a time nearly lost the use\r\nof his eyes.[58] But he was cured by regimen, and came to see as well as\r\never, he tells us; which we can easily believe was very well indeed. For\r\nhis work, as he planned it out, he needed all his powers. The _Convito_,\r\nfor example, was designed to admit of a full treatment of all that\r\nconcerns philosophy. It marks an earlier stage of his intellectual and\r\nspiritual life than does the opening of the _Inferno_. In it we have the\r\nfruit of the years during which he was wandering astray from his early\r\nideal, misled by what he afterwards came to count as a vain and\r\nprofitless curiosity. Most of its contents, as we have it,[59] are only\r\nindirectly interesting. It is impossible for most people to care for\r\ndiscussions, conducted with all the nicety of scholastic definition, on\r\nsuch subjects as the system of the universe as it was evolved out of the\r\nbrains of philosophers; the subject-matter of knowledge; and how we\r\nknow. But there is one section of it possessed of a very special\r\ninterest, the Fourth, in which he treats of the nature of nobility.\r\nThis he affirms to be independent of wealth or ancestry, and he finds\r\nevery one to be noble who practises the virtues proper to his time of\r\nlife. \'None of the Uberti of Florence or the Visconti of Milan can say\r\nhe is noble because belonging to such or such a race; for the Divine\r\nseed is sown not in a family but in the individual man.\' This amounts,\r\nit must be admitted, to no more than saying that high birth is one\r\nthing, and nobility of character another; but it is significant of what\r\nwere the current opinions, that Dante should be at such pains to\r\ndistinguish between the two qualities. The canzone which supplies the\r\ntext for the treatise closes with a picture of the noble soul at every\r\nstage of life, to which Chaucer may well have been indebted for his\r\ndescription of the true gentleman:[60]--\'The soul that is adorned by\r\nthis grace does not keep it hid, but from the day when soul is wed to\r\nbody shows it forth even until death. In early life she is modest,\r\nobedient, and gentle, investing the outward form and all its members\r\nwith a gracious beauty: in youth she is temperate and strong, full of\r\nlove and courteous ways, delighting in loyal deeds: in mature age she is\r\nprudent, and just, and apt to liberality, rejoicing to hear of others\'\r\ngood. Then in the fourth stage of life she is married again to God,[61]\r\nand contemplates her approaching end with thankfulness for all the\r\npast.\'[62]\r\n\r\nIn this passage it is less the poet that is heard than the sober\r\nmoralist, one with a ripe experience of life, and contemptuous of the\r\nvulgar objects of ambition. The calm is on the surface. As has been said\r\nabove, he was proud of his own birth, the more proud perhaps that his\r\nstation was but a middling one; and to the close of his life he hated\r\nupstarts with their sudden riches, while the Philip Argenti on whom in\r\nthe _Inferno_ he takes what has much the air of a private revenge may\r\nhave been only a specimen of the violent and haughty nobles with whom he\r\nstood on an uneasy footing.\r\n\r\nYet the impression we get of Dante\'s surroundings in Florence from the\r\n_Vita Nuova_ and other poems, from references in the _Comedy_, and from\r\nsome anecdotes more or less true which survive in the pages of Boccaccio\r\nand elsewhere, is on the whole a pleasant one. We should mistake did we\r\nthink of him as always in the guise of absorbed student or tearful\r\nlover. Friends he had, and society of various kinds. He tells how in a\r\nsevere illness he was nursed by a young and noble lady, nearly related\r\nto him by blood--his sister most probably; and other ladies are\r\nmentioned as watching in his sick-chamber.[63] With Forese and Piccarda\r\nDonati, brother and sister of the great Corso Donati, he was on terms of\r\nthe warmest friendship.[64] From the _Vita Nuova_ we can gather that,\r\neven when his whole heart fainted and failed at the mere sight of\r\nBeatrice, he was a favourite with other ladies and conversed familiarly\r\nwith them. The brother of Beatrice was his dear friend; while among\r\nthose of the elder generation he could reckon on the friendship of such\r\nmen as Guido Cavalcanti and Brunetto Latini. Through Latini he would,\r\neven as a young man, get the entry of the most lettered and\r\nintellectually active society of Florence. The tradition of his intimacy\r\nwith Giotto is supported by the mention he makes of the painter,[65] and\r\nby the fact, referred to in the _Vita Nuova_, that he was himself a\r\ndraughtsman. It is to be regretted there are not more anecdotes of him\r\non record like that which tells how one day as he drew an angel on his\r\ntablets he was broken in upon by \'certain people of importance.\' The\r\nmusician Casella, whom he \'woes to sing in Purgatory\'[66] and Belacqua,\r\nthe indolent good-humoured lutemaker,[67] are greeted by him in a tone\r\nof friendly warmth in the one case and of easy familiarity in the other,\r\nwhich help us to know the terms on which he stood with the quick-witted\r\nartist class in Florence.[68] Already he was in the enjoyment of a high\r\nreputation as a poet and scholar, and there seemed no limit to the\r\ngreatness he might attain to in his native town as a man of action as\r\nwell as a man of thought.\r\n\r\nIn most respects the Florence of that day was as fitting a home for a\r\nman of genius as could well be imagined. It was full of a life which\r\nseemed restless only because the possibilities of improvement for the\r\nindividual and the community seemed infinite. A true measure of its\r\npolitical progress and of the activity of men\'s minds is supplied by the\r\nchanges then being made in the outward aspect of the city. The duties of\r\nthe Government were as much municipal as political, and it would have\r\nsurprised a Florentine to be told that the one kind of service was of\r\nless dignity than the other. The population grew apace, and, to provide\r\nthe means for extending the city walls, every citizen, on pain of his\r\ntestament being found invalid, was required to bequeath a part of his\r\nestate to the public. Already the banks of the Arno were joined by three\r\nbridges of stone, and the main streets were paved with the\r\nirregularly-shaped blocks of lava still familiar to the sojourner in\r\nFlorence. But between the time of Dante\'s boyhood and the close of the\r\ncentury the other outstanding features of the city were greatly altered,\r\nor were in the course of change. The most important churches of\r\nFlorence, as he first knew it, were the Baptistery and the neighbouring\r\nsmall cathedral church of Santa Reparata; after these ranked the church\r\nof the Trinity, Santo Stefano, and some other churches which are now\r\nreplaced by larger ones, or of which the site alone can be discovered.\r\nOn the other side of the river, Samminiato with its elegant fa\xc3\xa7ade rose\r\nas now upon its hill.[69] The only great civic building was the Palace\r\nof the Podesta. The Old Market was and had long been the true centre of\r\nthe city\'s life.\r\n\r\nAt the time Dante went into exile Arnolfo was already working on the\r\ngreat new cathedral of St. Mary of the Flowers, the spacious Santa\r\nCroce, and the graceful Badia; and Santa Maria Novella was slowly\r\nassuming the perfection of form that was later to make it the favourite\r\nof Michel Angelo. The Palace of the Signory was already planned, though\r\nhalf a century was to elapse before its tower soared aloft to daunt the\r\nprivate strongholds which bristled, fierce and threatening, all over the\r\ncity. The bell-tower of Giotto, too, was of later erection--the only\r\npile we can almost regret that Dante never saw. The architect of it was\r\nhowever already adorning the walls of palace and cloister with paintings\r\nwhose inspiration was no longer, like that of the works they\r\novershadowed, drawn from the outworn motives of Byzantine art, but from\r\nthe faithful observation of nature.[70] He in painting and the Pisan\r\nschool in sculpture were furnishing the world with novel types of beauty\r\nin the plastic arts, answering to the \'sweet new style\' in verse of\r\nwhich it was Dante that discovered the secret.[71]\r\n\r\nFlorence was now by far the leading city in Tuscany. Its merchants and\r\nmoney-dealers were in correspondence with every Mediterranean port and\r\nwith every country of the West. Along with bales of goods and letters of\r\nexchange new ideas and fresh intelligence were always on the road to\r\nFlorence. The knowledge of what was going on in the world, and of what\r\nmen were thinking, was part of the stock-in-trade of the quick-witted\r\ncitizens, and they were beginning to be employed throughout Europe in\r\ndiplomatic work, till then almost a monopoly of churchmen. \'These\r\nFlorentines seem to me to form a fifth element,\' said Boniface, who had\r\nample experience of how accomplished they were.\r\n\r\nAt home they had full employment for their political genius; and still\r\nupon the old problem, of how to curb the arrogance of the class that, in\r\nplace of being satisfied to share in the general prosperity, sought its\r\nprofit in the maintenance of privilege. It is necessary, at the cost of\r\nwhat may look like repetition, to revert to the presence and activity of\r\nthis class in Florence, if we are to form a true idea of the\r\ncircumstances of Dante\'s life, and enter into the spirit with which much\r\nof the _Comedy_ is informed. Though many of the nobles were now engaged\r\nin commerce and figured among the popular leaders, most of the greater\r\nhouses stood proudly aloof from everything that might corrupt their\r\ngentility. These were styled the magnates: they found, as it were, a\r\nvocation for themselves in being nobles. Among them the true distinctive\r\nspirit of Ghibelinism survived, although none of them would now have\r\ndared to describe himself as a Ghibeline. Their strength lay partly in\r\nthe unlimited control they retained over the serfs on their landward\r\nestates; in the loyalty with which the members of a family held by one\r\nanother; in their great command of resources as the administrators of\r\nthe _Parte Guelfa_; and in the popularity they enjoyed with the smaller\r\npeople in consequence of their lavish expenditure, and frank if insolent\r\nmanners. By law scarcely the equals of the full citizens, in point of\r\nfact they tyrannised over them. Their houses, set like fortresses in the\r\ncrowded streets, frequently served as prisons and torture-chambers for\r\nthe low-born traders or artisans who might offend them.\r\n\r\nMeasures enough had been passed towards the close of the century with a\r\nview to curb the insolence of the magnates; but the difficulty was to\r\nget them put in force. At length, in 1294, they, with many additional\r\nreforms, were embodied in the celebrated Ordinances of Justice. These\r\nfor long were counted back to as the Great Charter of Florence--a Great\r\nCharter defining the popular rights and the disabilities of the\r\nbaronage. Punishments of special severity were enacted for nobles who\r\nshould wrong a plebeian, and the whole of a family or clan was made\r\nresponsible for the crimes and liabilities of its several members. The\r\nsmaller tradesmen were conciliated by being admitted to a share in\r\npolitical influence. If serfage was already abolished in the State of\r\nFlorence, it was the Ordinances which made it possible for the serf to\r\nuse his liberty.[72] But the greatest blow dealt to the nobles by the\r\nnew laws was their exclusion, as nobles, from all civil and political\r\noffices. These they could hold only by becoming members of one of the\r\ntrade guilds.[73] And to deprive a citizen of his rights it was enough\r\nto inscribe his name in the list of magnates.\r\n\r\nIt is not known in what year Dante became a member of the Guild of\r\nApothecaries. Without much reason it has been assumed that he was one of\r\nthe nobles who took advantage of the law of 1294. But there is no\r\nevidence that in his time the Alighieri ranked as magnates, and much\r\nground for believing that for some considerable time past they had\r\nbelonged to the order of full citizens.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary for every guildsman to practise the art or engage\r\nin the business to which his guild was devoted, and we are not required\r\nto imagine Dante as having anything to do with medicine or with the\r\nspices and precious stones in which the apothecaries traded. The guilds\r\nwere political as much as industrial associations, and of the public\r\nduties of his membership he took his full share. The constitution of the\r\nRepublic, jealously careful to limit the power of the individual\r\ncitizen, provided that the two chief executive officers, the Podesta and\r\nthe Captain of the People, should always be foreigners. They held office\r\nonly for six months. To each of them was assigned a numerous Council,\r\nand before a law could be abrogated or a new one passed it needed the\r\napproval of both these Councils, as well as that of the Priors, and of\r\nthe heads of the principal guilds. The Priors were six in number, one\r\nfor each district of the city. With them lay the administration in\r\ngeneral of the laws, and the conduct of foreign affairs. Their office\r\nwas elective, and held for two months.[74] Of one or other of the\r\nCouncils Dante is known to have been a member in 1295, 1296, 1300, and\r\n1301.[75] In 1299 he is found engaged on a political mission to the\r\nlittle hill-city of San Gemigniano, where in the town-house they still\r\nshow the pulpit from which he addressed the local senate.[76] From the\r\nmiddle of June till the middle of August 1300 he served as one of the\r\nPriors.[77]\r\n\r\nAt the time when Dante entered on this office, Florence was distracted\r\nby the feud of Blacks and Whites, names borrowed from the factions of\r\nPistoia, but fated to become best known from their use in the city which\r\nadopted them. The strength of the Blacks lay in the nobles whom the\r\nOrdinances of Justice had been designed to depress; both such of them as\r\nhad retained their standing as magnates, and such as, under the new law,\r\nhad unwillingly entered the ranks of the citizens. Already they had\r\nsucceeded in driving into exile Giano della Bella,[78] the chief author\r\nof the Ordinances; and their efforts--and those of the citizens who,\r\nfearing the growing power of the lesser guilds, were in sympathy with\r\nthem--were steadily directed to upset the reforms. An obvious means to\r\nthis end was to lower in popular esteem the public men whose policy it\r\nwas to govern firmly on the new lines. The leader of the discontented\r\nparty was Corso Donati, a man of small fortune, but of high birth; of\r\nsplendid personal appearance, open-handed, and of popular manners. He\r\nand they who went with him affected a violent Guelfism, their chance of\r\nrecovering the control of domestic affairs being the better the more\r\nthey could frighten the Florentines with threats of evils like those\r\nincurred by the Aretines and Pisans from Ghibeline oppression. It may be\r\nimagined what meaning the cry of Ghibeline possessed in days when there\r\nwas still a class of beggars in Florence--men of good names--whose eyes\r\nhad been torn out by Farinata and his kind.\r\n\r\nOne strong claim which Corso Donati had on the goodwill of his\r\nfellow-townsmen was that by his ready courage in pushing on the\r\nreserves, against superior orders, at the battle of Campaldino,[79] the\r\nday had been won to Florence and her allies. As he rode gallantly\r\nthrough the streets he was hailed as the Baron (_il Barone_), much as in\r\nthe last generation the victor of Waterloo was sufficiently\r\ndistinguished as the Duke. At the same battle, Vieri dei Cerchi, the\r\nleader of the opposite party of the Whites, had shown no less bravery,\r\nbut he was ignorant of the art, or despised it, of making political\r\ncapital out of the performance of his duty. In almost every respect he\r\noffered a contrast to Donati. He was of a new family, and his influence\r\ndepended not on landed possessions, though he had these too, but on\r\nwealth derived from commerce.[80] According to John Villani, a competent\r\nauthority on such a point,[81] he was at the head of one of the greatest\r\ntrading houses in the world. The same crowds that cheered Corso as the\r\ngreat Baron sneered at the reticent and cold-tempered merchant as the\r\nGhibeline. It was a strange perversion of ideas, and yet had this of\r\njustification, that all the nobles of Ghibeline tendency and all the\r\ncitizens who, on account of their birth, were suspected of leaning that\r\nway were driven into the party of the Whites by the mere fact of the\r\nBlacks hoisting so defiantly the Guelf flag, and commanding the\r\nresources of the _Parte Guelfa_. But if Ghibelinism meant, as fifty\r\nyears previously it did mean, a tendency to exalt privilege as against\r\nthe general liberties and to court foreign interference in the affairs\r\nof Florence, it was the Blacks and not the Whites who had served\r\nthemselves heirs to Ghibelinism. That the appeal was now taken to the\r\nPope instead of to the Emperor did not matter; or that French soldiers\r\nin place of German were called in to settle domestic differences.\r\n\r\nThe Roman See was at this time filled by Boniface VIII., who six years\r\npreviously, by violence and fraud, had procured the resignation of\r\nCelestine V.--him who made the great refusal.[82] Boniface was at once\r\narrogant and subtle, wholly faithless, and hampered by no scruple\r\neither of religion or humanity. But these qualities were too common\r\namong those who before and after him filled the Papal throne, to secure\r\nhim in a special infamy. That he has won from the ruthless hatred which\r\nblazes out against him in many a verse of Dante\'s,[83] and for this\r\nhatred he is indebted to his interference in the affairs of Florence,\r\nand what came as one of the fruits of it--the poet\'s exile.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, from the point of view not only of the interest of Rome but\r\nalso of Italy, there is much to be said for the policy of Boniface.\r\nGerman domination was a just subject of fear, and the Imperialist\r\nelement was still so strong in Northern and Central Italy, that if the\r\nEmperor Albert[84] had been a man of a more resolute ambition, he\r\nmight--so contemporaries deemed--have conquered Italy at the cost of a\r\nmarch through it. The cities of Romagna were already in Ghibeline\r\nrevolt, and it was natural that the Pope should seek to secure Florence\r\non the Papal side. It was for the Florentines rather than for him to\r\njudge what they would lose or gain by being dragged into the current of\r\ngeneral politics. He made a fair beginning with an attempt to reconcile\r\nthe two parties. The Whites were then the dominant faction, and to them\r\nreconciliation meant that their foes would at once divide the\r\ngovernment with them, and at the long-run sap the popular liberties,\r\nwhile the Pope\'s hand would soon be allowed to dip freely into the\r\ncommunal purse. The policy of the Whites was therefore one of steady\r\nopposition to all foreign meddling with Florence. But it failed to\r\nsecure general support, for without being Ghibeline in fact it had the\r\nair of being so; and the name of Ghibeline was one that no reasoning\r\ncould rob of its terrors.[85]\r\n\r\nAs was usual in Florence when political feeling ran high, the hotter\r\npartisans came to blows, and the streets were more than once disturbed\r\nby violence and bloodshed. To an onlooker it must have seemed as if the\r\ninterposition of some external authority was desirable; and almost on\r\nthe same day as the new Priors, of whom Dante was one and who were all\r\nWhites, took office in the June of 1300, the Cardinal Acquasparta\r\nentered the city, deputed by the Pope to establish peace. His proposals\r\nwere declined by the party in power, and having failed in his mission he\r\nleft the city, and took the priestly revenge upon it of placing it under\r\ninterdict.[86] Ere many months were passed, the Blacks, at a meeting of\r\nthe heads of the party, resolved to open negotiations anew with\r\nBoniface. For this illegal step some of them, including Corso Donati,\r\nwere ordered into exile by the authorities, who, to give an appearance\r\nof impartiality to their proceedings, at the same time banished some of\r\nthe Whites, and among them Guido Cavalcanti. It was afterwards made a\r\ncharge against Dante that he had procured the recall of his friend Guido\r\nand the other Whites from exile; but to this he could answer that he was\r\nnot then in office.[87] Corso in the meantime was using his enforced\r\nabsence from Florence to treat freely with the Pope.\r\n\r\nBoniface had already entered into correspondence with Charles of Valois,\r\nbrother of Philip, the reigning King of France, with the view of\r\nsecuring the services of a strongly-connected champion. It was the game\r\nthat had been played before by the Roman Court when Charles of Anjou was\r\ncalled to Italy to crush the Hohenstaufens. This second Charles was a\r\nman of ability of a sort, as he had given cruel proof in his brother\'s\r\nFlemish wars. By the death of his wife, daughter of his kinsman Charles\r\nII. of Naples and so grand-daughter of Charles of Anjou, he had lost the\r\ndominions of Maine and Anjou, and had got the nickname of Lackland from\r\nhis want of a kingdom. He lent a willing ear to Boniface, who presented\r\nhim with the crown of Sicily on condition that he first wrested it from\r\nthe Spaniard who wore it.[88] All the Papal influence was exerted to get\r\nmoney for the expenses of the descent on Sicily. Even churchmen were\r\nrequired to contribute, for it was a holy war, and the hope was that\r\nwhen Charles, the champion of the Church, had reduced Italy to\r\nobedience, won Sicily for himself by arms, and perhaps the Eastern\r\nEmpire by marriage, he would win the Holy Sepulchre for Christendom.\r\n\r\nCharles crossed the Alps in August 1301, with five hundred men-at-arms,\r\nand, avoiding Florence on his southward march, found Boniface at his\r\nfavourite residence of Anagni. He was created Pacificator of Tuscany,\r\nand loaded with other honours. What better served the purpose of his\r\nambition, he was urged to retrace his steps and justify his new title by\r\nrestoring peace to Florence. There the Whites were still in power, but\r\nthey dared not declare themselves openly hostile to the Papal and Guelf\r\ninterest by refusing him admission to the city. He came with gentle\r\nwords, and ready to take the most stringent oaths not to tamper with the\r\nliberties of the Commonwealth; but once he had gained an entrance\r\n(November 1301) and secured his hold on Florence, he threw off every\r\ndisguise, gave full play to his avarice, and amused himself with looking\r\non at the pillage of the dwellings and warehouses of the Whites by the\r\nparty of Corso Donati. By all this, says Dante, Charles \'gained no\r\nland,\' Lackland as he was, \'but only sin and shame.\'[89]\r\n\r\nThere is a want of precise information as to the events of this time.\r\nBut it seems probable that Dante formed one of an embassy sent by the\r\nrulers of Florence to the Pope in the autumn of this year; and that on\r\nthe occasion of the entrance of Charles he was absent from Florence.\r\nWhat the embassy had to propose which Boniface could be expected to be\r\nsatisfied with, short of complete submission, is not known and is not\r\neasy to guess. It seems clear at least that Dante cannot have been\r\nchosen as a person likely to be specially pleasing to the Roman Court.\r\nWithin the two years preceding he had made himself prominent in the\r\nvarious Councils of which he was a member, by his sturdy opposition to\r\naffording aid to the Pope in his Romagnese wars. It is even possible\r\nthat his theory of the Empire was already more or less known to\r\nBoniface, and as that Pontiff claimed Imperial authority over such\r\nstates as Florence, this would be sufficient to secure him a rough\r\nreception.[90] Where he was when the terrible news came to him that for\r\nsome days there had been no law in Florence, and that Corso Donati was\r\nsharing in the triumph of Charles, we do not know. Presageful of worse\r\nthings to come, he did not seek to return, and is said to have been in\r\nSiena when he heard that, on the 27th January 1302, he had been\r\nsentenced to a heavy fine and political disabilities for having been\r\nguilty of extortion while a Prior, of opposing the coming of Charles,\r\nand of crimes against the peace of Florence and the interest of the\r\n_Parte Guelfa_. If the fine was not paid within three days his goods and\r\nproperty were to be confiscated. This condemnation he shared with three\r\nothers. In the following March he was one of twelve condemned, for\r\ncontumacy, to be burned alive if ever they fell into the hands of the\r\nFlorentine authorities. We may perhaps assume that the cruel sentence,\r\nas well as the charge of peculation, was uttered only in order to\r\nconform to some respectable precedents.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nBesides Dante many other Whites had been expelled from Florence.[91]\r\nWhether they liked it or not, they were forced to seek aid from the\r\nGhibelines of Arezzo and Romagna. This led naturally to a change of\r\npolitical views, and though at the time of their banishment all of them\r\nwere Guelfs in various degrees, as months and years went on they\r\ndeveloped into Ghibelines, more or less declared. Dissensions, too,\r\nwould be bred among them out of recriminations touching the past, and\r\ncharges of deserting the general interest for the sake of securing\r\nprivate advantage in the way of making peace with the Republic. For a\r\ntime, however, the common desire of gaining a return to Florence held\r\nthem together. Of the Council constituted to bring this about, Dante was\r\na member. Once only with his associates does he appear to have come the\r\nlength of formal negotiations with a view to getting back. Charles of\r\nValois had passed away from the temporary scene of his extortions and\r\ntreachery, upon the futile quest of a crown. Boniface, ere being\r\npersecuted to death by his old ally, Philip of France (1303), had vainly\r\nattempted to check the cruelty of the Blacks; and Benedict, his\r\nsuccessor, sent the Cardinal of Ostia to Florence with powers to\r\nreconcile the two parties. Dante is usually credited with the\r\ncomposition of the letter in which Vieri dei Cerchi and his\r\nfellow-exiles answered the call of the Cardinal to discuss the\r\nconditions of their return home. All that had been done by the banished\r\nparty, said the letter, had been done for the public good.[92] The\r\nnegotiations came to nothing; nor were the exiles more fortunate in\r\narms. Along with their allies they did once succeed by a sudden dash in\r\npenetrating to the market-place, and Florence lay within their grasp\r\nwhen, seized with panic, they turned and fled from the city, which many\r\nof them were never to see again.\r\n\r\nAlmost certainly Dante took no active part in this attempt, and indeed\r\nthere is little to show that he was ever heartily associated with the\r\nexiles. In his own words, he was compelled to break with his companions\r\nowing to their imbecility and wickedness, and to form a party by\r\nhimself.[93] With the Whites, then, he had little more to do; and the\r\nstory of their fortunes need not longer detain us. It is enough to say\r\nthat while, like Dante, the chief men among them were for ever excluded\r\nfrom Florence, the principles for which they had contended survived, and\r\neven obtained something like a triumph within its walls. The success of\r\nDonati and his party, though won with the help of the people, was too\r\nclearly opposed to the popular interest to be permanent. Ere long the\r\ninveterate contradiction between magnate and merchant was again to\r\nchange the course of Florentine politics; the disabilities against\r\nlawless nobles were again to be enforced; and Corso Donati himself was\r\nto be crushed in the collision of passions he had evoked but could not\r\ncontrol (1308). Though tenderly attached to members of his family, Dante\r\nbore Corso a grudge as having been the chief agent in procuring his\r\nexile--a grudge which years could do nothing to wipe out. He places in\r\nthe mouth of Forese Donati a prophecy of the great Baron\'s shameful\r\ndeath, expressed in curt and scornful words, terrible from a\r\nbrother.[94] It is no figure of speech to say that Dante nursed revenge.\r\n\r\nFor some few years his hopes were set on Henry of Luxemburg, elected\r\nEmperor in 1308. A Ghibeline, in the ordinary sense of the term, Dante\r\nnever was. We have in his _De Monarchia_ a full account of the\r\nconception he had formed of the Empire--that of authority in temporal\r\naffairs embodied in a just ruler, who, being already supreme, would be\r\ndelivered from all personal ambition; who should decree justice and be a\r\nrefuge for all that were oppressed. He was to be the captain of\r\nChristian society and the guardian of civil right; as in another sphere\r\nthe Pope was to be the shepherd of souls and the guardian of the deposit\r\nof Divine truth. In Dante\'s eyes the one great officer was as much God\'s\r\nvicegerent as the other. While the most that a Ghibeline or a moderate\r\nGuelf would concede was that there should be a division of power between\r\nPope and Emperor--the Ghibeline leaving it to the Emperor and the Guelf\r\nto the Pope to define their provinces--Dante held, and in this he stood\r\nalmost alone among politicians, that they ought to be concerned with\r\nwholly different kingdoms, and that Christendom was wronged by the\r\ntrespass of either upon the other\'s domain. An equal wrong was done by\r\nthe neglect by either of his duty, and both, as Dante judged, had been\r\nshamefully neglecting it. For more than half a century no Emperor had\r\nset foot in Italy; and since the Papal Court had under Clement V. been\r\nremoved to Avignon (1305), the Pope had ceased to be a free agent, owing\r\nto his neighbourhood to France and the unscrupulous Philip.[95]\r\n\r\nDante trusted that the virtuous single-minded Henry VII. would prove a\r\nmonarch round whom all the best in Italy might gather to make him\r\nEmperor in deed as well as in name. His judgment took the colour of his\r\nhopes, for under the awful shadow of the Emperor he trusted to enter\r\nFlorence. Although no Ghibeline or Imperialist in the vulgar sense, he\r\nconstituted himself Henry\'s apologist and herald; and in letters\r\naddressed to the \'wicked Florentines,\' to the Emperor, and to the\r\nPrinces and Peoples of Italy, he blew as it were a trumpet-blast of\r\ntriumph over the Emperor\'s enemies and his own. Henry had crossed the\r\nAlps, and was tarrying in the north of Italy, when Dante, with a keen\r\neye for where the key of the situation lay, sharpened by his own wishes,\r\nurged him to lose no more time in reducing the Lombard cities to\r\nobedience, but to descend on Florence, the rotten sheep which was\r\ncorrupting all the Italian flock. The men of Florence he bids prepare to\r\nreceive the just reward of their crimes.\r\n\r\nThe Florentines answered Dante\'s bitter invective and the Emperor\'s\r\nmilder promises by an unwearied opposition with the arms which their\r\nincreasing command of all that tends to soften life made them now less\r\nwilling to take up, and by the diplomacy in which they were supreme The\r\nexiles were recalled, always excepting the more stubborn or dangerous;\r\nand among these was reckoned Dante. Alliances were made on all hands, an\r\nart which Henry was notably wanting in the trick of. Wherever he turned\r\nhe was met and checkmated by the Florentines, who, wise by experience,\r\nwere set on retaining control of their own affairs. After his coronation\r\nat Rome (1312),[96] he marched northwards, and with his Pisan and\r\nAretine allies for six weeks laid fruitless siege to Florence. King\r\nRobert of Naples, whose aid he had hoped to gain by means of a family\r\nalliance, was joined to the league of Guelfs, and Henry passed away from\r\nFlorence to engage in an enterprise against the Southern Kingdom, a\r\ndesign cut short by his death (1313). He was the last Emperor that ever\r\nsought to take the part in Italian affairs which on Dante\'s theory\r\nbelonged to the Imperial office. Well-meaning but weak, he was not the\r\nman to succeed in reducing to practice a scheme of government which had\r\nbroken down even in the strong hands of the two Fredericks, and ere the\r\nCommonwealths of Italy had become each as powerful as a Northern\r\nkingdom. To explain his failure, Dante finds that his descent into Italy\r\nwas unseasonable: he came too soon. Rather, it may be said, he came far\r\ntoo late.[97]\r\n\r\nWhen, on the death of Henry, Dante was disappointed in his hopes of a\r\ntrue revival of the Empire, he devoted himself for a time to urging the\r\nrestoration of the Papal Court to Rome, so that Italy might at least not\r\nbe left without some centre of authority. In a letter addressed to the\r\nItalian Cardinals, he besought them to replace Clement V., who died in\r\n1314,[98] by an Italian Pope. Why should they, he asked, resign this\r\ngreat office into Gascon hands? Why should Rome, the true centre of\r\nChristendom, be left deserted and despised? His appeal was fruitless, as\r\nindeed it could not fail to be with only six Italian Cardinals in a\r\nCollege of twenty-four; and after a vacancy of two years the Gascon\r\nClement was succeeded by another Gascon. Although Dante\'s motives in\r\nmaking this attempt were doubtless as purely patriotic as those which\r\ninspired Catherine of Siena to similar action a century later, he met,\r\nwe may be sure, with but little sympathy from his former\r\nfellow-citizens. They were intent upon the interests of Florence alone,\r\nand even of these they may sometimes have taken a narrow view. His was\r\nthe wider patriotism of the Italian, and it was the whole Peninsula\r\nthat he longed to see delivered from French influence and once more\r\nprovided with a seat of authority in its midst, even if it were only\r\nthat of spiritual power. The Florentines for their part, desirous of\r\nsecurity against the incursions of the northern horde, were rather set\r\non retaining the goodwill of France than on enjoying the neighbourhood\r\nof the Pope. In this they were guilty of no desertion of their\r\nprinciples. Their Guelfism had never been more than a mode of minding\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nFor about three years (1313-1316) the most dangerous foe of Florence was\r\nUguccione de la Faggiuola, a partisan Ghibeline chief, sprung from the\r\nmountain-land of Urbino, which lies between Tuscany and Romagna. He made\r\nhimself lord of Pisa and Lucca, and defeated the Florentines and their\r\nallies in the great battle of Montecatini (1315). To him Dante is\r\nbelieved to have attached himself.[99] It would be easy for the Republic\r\nto form an exaggerated idea of the part which the exile had in shaping\r\nthe policy or contributing to the success of his patron; and we are not\r\nsurprised to find that, although Dante\'s fighting days were done, he was\r\nafter the defeat subjected to a third condemnation (November 1315). If\r\ncaught, he was to lose his head; and his sons, or some of them, were\r\nthreatened with the same fate. The terms of the sentence may again have\r\nbeen more severe than the intentions of those who uttered it. However\r\nthis may be, an amnesty was passed in the course of the following year,\r\nand Dante was urged to take advantage of it. He found the conditions of\r\npardon too humiliating. Like a malefactor he would require to walk,\r\ntaper in hand and a shameful mitre on his head, to the church of St\r\nJohn, and there make an oblation for his crimes. It was not in this\r\nfashion that in his more hopeful hours the exile had imagined his\r\nrestoration. If ever he trod again the pavement of his beautiful St\r\nJohn\'s, it was to be proudly, as a patriot touching whom his country had\r\nconfessed her sins; or, with a poet\'s more bashful pride, to receive the\r\nlaurel crown beside the font in which he was baptized. But as he would\r\nnot enter his well beloved, well hated Florence on the terms imposed by\r\nhis enemies, so he never had the chance of entering it on his own. The\r\nspirit in which he, as it were, turned from the open gates of his native\r\ntown is well expressed in a letter to a friend, who would seem to have\r\nbeen a churchman who had tried to win his compliance with the terms of\r\nthe pardon. After thanking his correspondent for his kindly eagerness to\r\nrecover him, and referring to the submission required, he says:--\'And is\r\nit in this glorious fashion that Dante Alighieri, wearied with an almost\r\ntrilustral exile, is recalled to his country? Is this the desert of an\r\ninnocence known to all, and of laborious study which for long has kept\r\nhim asweat?... But, Father, this is no way for me to return to my\r\ncountry by; though if by you or others one can be hit upon through which\r\nthe honour and fame of Dante will take no hurt, it shall be followed by\r\nme with no tardy steps. If by none such Florence is to be entered, I\r\nwill never enter Florence. What then! Can I not, wherever I may be,\r\nbehold the sun and stars? Is not meditation upon the sweetness of truth\r\nas free to me in one place as another? To enjoy this, no need to submit\r\nmyself ingloriously and with ignominy to the State and People of\r\nFlorence! And wherever I may be thrown, in any case I trust at least to\r\nfind daily bread.\'\r\n\r\nThe cruelty and injustice of Florence to her greatest son have been the\r\nsubject of much eloquent blame. But, in justice to his contemporaries,\r\nwe must try to see Dante as they saw him, and bear in mind that the very\r\nqualities fame makes so much of--his fervent temper and devotion to\r\ngreat ideas--placed him out of the reach of common sympathy. Others\r\nbesides him had been banished from Florence, with as much or as little\r\nreason, and had known the saltness of bread which has been begged, and\r\nthe steepness of strange stairs. The pains of banishment made them the\r\nmore eager to have it brought to a close. With Dante all that he\r\nsuffered went to swell the count of grievances for which a reckoning was\r\nsome day to be exacted. The art of returning was, as he himself knew\r\nwell, one he was slow to learn.[100] His noble obstinacy, which would\r\nstoop to no loss of dignity or sacrifice of principle, must excite our\r\nadmiration; it also goes far to account for his difficulty in getting\r\nback. We can even imagine that in Florence his refusal to abate one\r\ntittle of what was due to him in the way of apology was, for a time, the\r\nsubject of wondering speculation to the citizens, ere they turned again\r\nto their everyday affairs of politics and merchandise. Had they been\r\nmore used to deal with men in whom a great genius was allied to a\r\nstubborn sense of honour, they would certainly have left less room in\r\ntheir treatment of Dante for happier ages to cavil at.\r\n\r\nHow did the case stand? In the letter above quoted from, Dante says that\r\nhis innocence was known to all. As far as the charge of corruption in\r\nhis office-bearing went, his banishment--no one can doubt it for a\r\nmoment--was certainly unjust; and the political changes in Florence\r\nsince the death of Corso Donati had taken all the life out of the other\r\ncharges. But by his eager appeals to the Emperor to chastise the\r\nFlorentines he had raised fresh barriers against his return. The\r\ngovernors of the Republic could not be expected to adopt his theory of\r\nthe Empire and share his views of the Imperial claims; and to them Dante\r\nmust have seemed as much guilty of disloyalty to the Commonwealth in\r\ninviting the presence of Henry, as Corso Donati had been in Dante\'s eyes\r\nfor his share in bringing Charles of Valois to harry Florence. His\r\npolitical writings since his exile--and all his writings were more or\r\nless political--had been such as might well confirm or create an opinion\r\nof him as a man difficult to live with, as one whose intellectual\r\narrogance had a ready organ in his unsparing tongue or pen. Rumour\r\nwould most willingly dwell upon and distort the features of his\r\ncharacter and conduct that separated him from the common herd. And to\r\nadd to all this, even after he had deserted the party of the Whites in\r\nexile, and had become a party to himself, he found his friends and\r\npatrons--for where else could he find them?--among the foes of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nHistory never abhors a vacuum so much as when she has to deal with the\r\nlife of a great man, and for those who must have details of Dante\'s\r\ncareer during the nineteen years which elapsed between his banishment\r\nand his death, the industry of his biographers has exhausted every\r\navailable hint, while some of them press into their service much that\r\nhas only the remotest bearing on their hero. If even one-half of their\r\nsuppositions were adopted, we should be forced to the conclusion that\r\nthe _Comedy_ and all the other works of his exile were composed in the\r\nintervals of a very busy life. We have his own word for this much,\r\n(_Convito_ i. 3,) that since he was cast forth out of Florence--in which\r\nhe would \'fain rest his wearied soul and fulfil his appointed time\'--he\r\nhad been \'a pilgrim, nay, even a mendicant,\' in every quarter of\r\nItaly,[101] and had \'been held cheap by many who, because of his fame,\r\nhad looked to find him come in another guise.\' But he gives no journal\r\nof his wanderings, and, as will have been observed, says no word of any\r\ncountry but Italy. Keeping close to well-ascertained facts, it seems\r\nestablished that in the earlier period of his exile he sojourned with\r\nmembers of the great family of the Counts Guidi,[102] and that he also\r\nfound hospitality with the Malaspini,[103] lords of the Val di Magra,\r\nbetween Genoa and Lucca. At a still earlier date (August 1306) he is\r\nfound witnessing a deed in Padua. It was most probably in the same year\r\nthat Dante found Giotto there, painting the walls of the Scrovegni\r\nChapel, and was courteously welcomed by the artist, and taken to his\r\nhouse.[104] At some time of his life he studied at Bologna: John Villani\r\nsays, during his exile.[105] Of his supposed residence in Paris, though\r\nit is highly probable, there is a want of proof; of a visit to England,\r\nnone at all that is worth a moment\'s consideration. Some of his\r\ncommentators and biographers seem to think he was so short-witted that\r\nhe must have been in a place before it could occur to him to name it in\r\nhis verse.\r\n\r\nWe have Dante\'s own word for it that he found his exile almost\r\nintolerable. Besides the bitter resentment which he felt at the\r\ninjustice of it, he probably cherished the conviction that his career\r\nhad been cut short when he was on the point of acquiring great influence\r\nin affairs. The illusion may have been his--one not uncommon among men\r\nof a powerful imagination--that, given only due opportunity, he could\r\nmould the active life of his time as easily as he moulded and fashioned\r\nthe creations of his fancy. It was, perhaps, owing to no fault of his\r\nown that when a partial opportunity had offered itself, he failed to get\r\nhis views adopted in Florence; indeed, to judge from the kind of\r\nemployment in which he was more than once engaged for his patrons, he\r\nmust have been possessed of no little business tact. Yet, as when his\r\nfeelings were deeply concerned his words knew no restraint, so his hopes\r\nwould partake of the largeness of his genius. In the restored Empire,\r\nwhich he was almost alone in longing for as he conceived of it, he may\r\nhave imagined for himself a place beside Henry like what in Frederick\'s\r\ncourt had been filled by Pier delle Vigne--the man who held both keys to\r\nthe Emperor\'s heart, and opened and shut it as he would.[106]\r\n\r\nThus, as his exile ran on it would grow sadder with the accumulating\r\nmemories of hopes deferred and then destroyed, and of dreams which had\r\nfaded away in the light of a cheerless reality. But some consolations he\r\nmust have found even in the conditions of his exile. He had leisure for\r\nmeditation, and time enough to spend in that other world which was all\r\nhis own. With the miseries of a wanderer\'s life would come not a few of\r\nits sweets--freedom from routine, and the intellectual stimulus supplied\r\nby change of place. Here and there he would find society such as he\r\ncared for--that of scholars, theologians, and men familiar with every\r\ncourt and school of Christendom. And, beyond all, he would get access to\r\nbooks that at home he might never have seen. It was no spare diet that\r\nwould serve his mind while he was making such ample calls on it for his\r\ngreat work. As it proceeds we seem to detect a growing fulness of\r\nknowledge, and it is by reason of the more learned treatment, as well as\r\nthe loftier theme of the Third Cantica, that so many readers, when once\r\nwell at sea in the _Paradiso_, recognise the force of the warning with\r\nwhich it begins.[107]\r\n\r\nWhat amount of intercourse he was able to maintain with Florence during\r\nhis wanderings is a matter of mere speculation, although of a more\r\ninteresting kind than that concerned with the chronology of his uneasy\r\ntravels. That he kept up at least some correspondence with his friends\r\nis proved by the letter regarding the terms of his pardon. There is also\r\nthe well-known anecdote told by Boccaccio as to the discovery and\r\ndespatch to him of the opening Cantos of the _Inferno_--an anecdote we\r\nmay safely accept as founded on fact, although Boccaccio\'s informants\r\nmay have failed to note at the time what the manuscript consisted of,\r\nand in the course of years may have magnified the importance of their\r\ndiscovery. With his wife he would naturally communicate on subjects of\r\ncommon interest--as, for instance, that of how best to save or recover\r\npart of his property--and especially regarding the welfare of his sons,\r\nof whom two are found to be with him when he acquires something like a\r\nsettlement in Verona.\r\n\r\nIt is quite credible that, as Boccaccio asserts, he would never after\r\nhis exile was once begun \'go to his wife or suffer her to join him where\r\nhe was;\' although the statement is probably an extension of the fact\r\nthat she never did join him. In any case it is to make too large a use\r\nof the words to find in them evidence, as has frequently been done, of\r\nthe unhappiness of all his married life, and of his utter estrangement\r\nfrom Gemma during his banishment. The union--marriage of convenience\r\nthough it was--might be harmonious enough as long as things went\r\nmoderately well with the pair. Dante was never wealthy, but he seems to\r\nhave had his own house in Florence and small landed possessions in its\r\nneighbourhood.[108] That before his banishment he was considerably in\r\ndebt appears to be ascertained;[109] but, without knowing the\r\ncircumstances in which he borrowed, it is impossible to be sure whether\r\nhe may not only have been making use of his credit in order to put out\r\npart of his means to advantage in some of the numerous commercial\r\nenterprises in which his neighbours were engaged. In any case his career\r\nmust have seemed full of promise till he was driven into banishment.\r\nWhen that blow had fallen, it is easy to conceive how what if it was not\r\nmutual affection had come to serve instead of it--esteem and\r\nforbearance--would be changed into indifference with the lapse of months\r\nand years of enforced separation, embittered and filled on both sides\r\nwith the mean cares of indigence, and, it may be, on Gemma\'s side with\r\nthe conviction that her husband had brought her with himself into\r\ndisgrace. If all that is said by Boccaccio and some of Dante\'s enemies\r\nas to his temperament and behaviour were true, we could only hope that\r\nGemma\'s indifference was deep enough to save her from the pangs of\r\njealousy. And on the other hand, if we are to push suspicion to its\r\nutmost length, we may find an allusion to his own experience in the\r\nlines where Dante complains of how soon a widow forgets her\r\nhusband.[110] But this is all matter of the merest speculation. Gemma\r\nis known to have been alive in 1314.[111] She brought up her children,\r\nsays Boccaccio, upon a trifling part of her husband\'s confiscated\r\nestate, recovered on the plea that it was a portion of her dowry. There\r\nmay have been difficulties of a material kind, insuperable save to an\r\nardent love that was not theirs, in the way of Gemma\'s joining her\r\nhusband in any of his cities of refuge.\r\n\r\nComplete evidence exists of Dante\'s having in his later years lived for\r\na longer or shorter time in the three cities of Lucca, Verona, and\r\nRavenna. In Purgatory he meets a shade from Lucca, in the murmur of\r\nwhose words he catches he \'knows not what of Gentucca;\'[112] and when he\r\ncharges the Lucchese to speak plainly out, he is told that Lucca shall\r\nyet be found pleasant by him because of a girl not yet grown to\r\nwomanhood. Uguccione, acting in the interest of Pisa, took possession of\r\nLucca in 1314, and Dante is supposed to have taken up his residence\r\nthere for some considerable time. What we may certainly infer from his\r\nown words in the _Purgatorio_ is that they were written after a stay in\r\nLucca had been sweetened to him by the society of a lady named Gentucca.\r\nHe cannot well have found shelter there before the city was held by\r\nUguccione; and research has established that at least two ladies of the\r\nuncommon name of Gentucca were resident there in 1314. From the whole\r\ntone of his allusion--the mention of her very name and of her innocent\r\ngirlhood--we may gather that there was nothing in his liking for her of\r\nwhich he had any reason to feel ashamed. In the _Inferno_ he had covered\r\nthe whole people of Lucca with his scorn.[113] By the time he got thus\r\nfar with the _Purgatorio_ his thoughts of the place were all softened by\r\nhis memory of one fair face--or shall we rather say, of one\r\ncompassionate and womanly soul? That Dante was more than susceptible to\r\nfeminine charms is coarsely asserted by Boccaccio.[114] But on such a\r\nmatter Boccaccio is a prejudiced witness, and, in the absence of\r\nsufficient proof to the contrary, justice requires us to assume that the\r\ntenor of Dante\'s life was not at variance with that of his writings. He\r\nwho was so severe a judge of others was not, as we can infer from more\r\nthan one passage of the _Comedy_, a lenient judge when his own failings\r\nwere concerned.[115] That his conduct never fell short of his standard\r\nno one will venture to maintain. But what should have hindered him, in\r\nhis hours of weariness and when even his hold on the future seemed to\r\nslacken, in lonely castle or strange town, to seek sympathy from some\r\nfair woman who might remind him in something of Beatrice?[116]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1316, Uguccione was driven out of Lucca and Pisa, that great\r\npartisan took military service with Can Grande. It has been disputed\r\nwhether Dante had earlier enjoyed the hospitality of the Scaligers, or\r\nwas indebted for his first reception in Verona to the good offices of\r\nUguccione. It is barely credible that by this time in his life he stood\r\nin need of any one to answer for him in the court of Can Grande. His\r\nfame as a political writer must have preceded him; and it was of a\r\ncharacter to commend him to the good graces of the great Imperialist. In\r\nhis _De Monarchia_ he had, by an exhaustive treatment of propositions\r\nwhich now seem childish or else the mere commonplaces of everyday\r\npolitical argument, established the right of the civil power to\r\nindependence of Church authority; and though to the Scaliger who aimed\r\nat becoming Imperial lieutenant for all the North of Italy he might seem\r\nneedlessly tender to the spiritual lordship of the Holy Father, yet the\r\ndrift of his reasoning was all in favour of the Ghibeline position.[117]\r\nBesides this he had written on the need of refining the dialects of\r\nItalian, and reducing them to a language fit for general use in the\r\nwhole of the Peninsula; and this with a novelty of treatment and wealth\r\nof illustration unequalled before or since in any first work on such a\r\nsubject.[118] And, what would recommend him still more to a youthful\r\nprince of lofty taste, he was the poet of the \'sweet new style\' of the\r\n_Vita Nuova_, and of sonnets, ballads, and canzoni rich in language and\r\nthought beyond the works of all previous poets in the vulgar tongues.\r\nAdd to this that the _Comedy_ was already written, and published up,\r\nperhaps, to the close of the _Purgatorio_, and that all Italy was eager\r\nto find who had a place, and what kind of place, in the strange new\r\nworld from which the veil was being withdrawn; and it is easy to imagine\r\nthat Dante\'s reception at Can Grande\'s court was rather that of a man\r\nboth admired and feared for his great genius, than that of a wandering\r\nscholar and grumbling exile.\r\n\r\nAt what time Dante came to Verona, and for how long he stayed, we have\r\nno means of fixing with certainty. He himself mentions being there in\r\n1320,[119] and it is usually supposed that his residence covered three\r\nyears previous to that date; as also that it was shared by his two sons,\r\nPiero and Jacopo. One of these was afterwards to find a settlement at\r\nVerona in a high legal post. Except some frivolous legends, there is no\r\nevidence that Dante met with anything but generous treatment from Can\r\nGrande. A passage of the _Paradiso_, written either towards the close of\r\nthe poet\'s residence at Verona, or after he had left it, is full of a\r\npraise of the great Scaliger so magnificent[120] as fully to make amends\r\nfor the contemptuous mention in the _Purgatorio_ of his father and\r\nbrother.[121] To Can Grande the _Paradiso_ was dedicated by the author\r\nin a long epistle containing an exposition of how the first Canto of\r\nthat Cantica, and, by implication, the whole of the poem, is to be\r\ninterpreted. The letter is full of gratitude for favours already\r\nreceived, and of expectation of others yet to come. From the terms of\r\nthe dedication it has been assumed that ere it was made the whole of the\r\n_Paradiso_ was written, and that Dante praises the lord of Verona after\r\na long experience of his bounty.[122]\r\n\r\nWhether owing to the restlessness of an exile, or to some prospect of\r\nattaining a state of greater ease or of having the command of more\r\ncongenial society, we cannot tell; but from the splendid court of Can\r\nGrande he moved down into Romagna, to Ravenna, the city which of all in\r\nItaly would now be fixed upon by the traveller as the fittest place for\r\na man of genius, weighed down by infinite sorrows, to close his days in\r\nand find a tomb. Some writers on the life of Dante will have it that in\r\nRavenna he spent the greater part of his exile, and that when he is\r\nfound elsewhere--in Lucca or Verona--he is only on a temporary absence\r\nfrom his permanent home.[123] But this conclusion requires some facts to\r\nbe ignored, and others unduly dwelt on. In any case his patron there,\r\nduring at least the last year or two of his life, was Guido Novello of\r\nPolenta, lord of Ravenna, the nephew of her who above all the persons of\r\nthe _Comedy_ lives in the hearts of its readers.\r\n\r\nBernardino, the brother of Francesca and uncle of Guido, had fought on\r\nthe side of Florence at the battle of Campaldino, and Dante may then\r\nhave become acquainted with him. The family had the reputation of being\r\nmoderate Guelfs; but ere this the exile, with his ripe experience of\r\nmen, had doubtless learned, while retaining intact his own opinions as\r\nto what was the true theory of government, to set good-heartedness and\r\na noble aim in life above political orthodoxy. This Guido Novello--the\r\nyounger Guido--bears the reputation of having been well-informed, of\r\ngentle manners, and fond of gathering around him men accomplished in\r\nliterature and the fine arts. On the death of Dante he made a formal\r\noration in honour of the poet. If his welcome of Dante was as cordial as\r\nis generally supposed, and as there is no reason to doubt that it was,\r\nit proved his magnanimity; for in the _Purgatorio_ a family specially\r\nhostile to the Polentas had been mentioned with honour,[124] while that\r\nto which his wife belonged had been lightly spoken of. How he got over\r\nthe condemnation of his kinswoman to Inferno--even under such gentle\r\nconditions--it would be more difficult to understand were there not\r\nreason to believe that ere Dante went to Ravenna it had come to be a\r\nmatter of pride in Italy for a family to have any of its members placed\r\nanywhere in that other world of which Dante held the key.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if we might assume that the poet\'s last months or years were\r\nsoothed by the society of his daughter--the child whom he had named\r\nafter the object of his first and most enduring love.[125] Whether or\r\nnot he was acting as Ambassador for Guido to Venice when he caught his\r\nlast illness, it appears to be pretty well established that he was held\r\nin honour by his patron and all around him.[126] For his hours of\r\nmeditation he had the solemn churches of Ravenna with their storied\r\nwalls,[127] and the still more solemn pine forest of Classis, by him\r\nfirst annexed to the world of Romance.[128] For hours of relaxation,\r\nwhen they came, he had neighbours who dabbled in letters and who could\r\nat any rate sympathise with him in his love of study. He maintained\r\ncorrespondence with poets and scholars in other cities. In at least one\r\ninstance this was conducted in the bitter fashion with which the\r\nhumanists of a century or two later were to make the world\r\nfamiliar;[129] but with the Bolognese scholar, Giovanni del Virgilio, he\r\nengaged in a good-humoured, half-bantering exchange of Latin pastoral\r\npoems, through the artificial imagery of which there sometimes breaks a\r\nnatural thought, as when in answer to the pedant\'s counsel to renounce\r\nthe vulgar tongue and produce in Latin something that will entitle him\r\nto receive the laurel crown in Bologna, he declares that if ever he is\r\ncrowned as a poet it will be on the banks of the Arno.\r\n\r\nMost of the material for forming a judgment of how Dante stood affected\r\nto the religious beliefs of his time is to be gathered from the\r\n_Comedy_, and the place for considering it would rather be in an essay\r\non that work than in a sketch of his life which necessity compels to be\r\nswift. A few words may however be here devoted to the subject, as it is\r\none with some bearing on the manner in which he would be regarded by\r\nthose around him, and through that on the tenor of his life. That Dante\r\nconformed to Church observances, and, except with a few malevolent\r\ncritics, bore the reputation of a good Catholic, there can be no doubt.\r\nIt was as a politician and not as a heretic that he suffered\r\npersecution; and when he died he was buried in great honour within the\r\nFranciscan Church at Ravenna. Some few years after his death, it is\r\ntrue, his _De Monarchia_ was burned as heretical by orders of the Papal\r\nLegate in Lombardy, who would gladly, if he could, have had the bones of\r\nthe author exhumed to share the fate of his book. But all this was only\r\nbecause the partisans of Lewis of Bavaria were making political capital\r\nout of the treatise.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to demonstrate that in spite of his outward\r\nconformity Dante was an unbeliever at heart, and that the _Comedy_ is\r\ndevoted to the promulgation of a Ghibeline heresy--of which, we may be\r\nsure, no Ghibeline ever heard--and to the overthrow of all that the\r\nauthor professed most devoutly to believe.[130] Other critics of a more\r\nsober temper in speculation would find in him a Catholic who held the\r\nCatholic beliefs with the same slack grasp as the teaching of Luther was\r\nheld by Lessing or Goethe.[131] But this is surely to misread the\r\n_Comedy_, which is steeped from beginning to end in a spirit of the\r\nwarmest faith in the great Christian doctrines. It was no mere\r\nintellectual perception of these that Dante had--or professed to\r\nhave--for when in Paradise he has satisfied Saint Peter of his being\r\npossessed of a just conception of the nature of faith, and is next asked\r\nif, besides knowing what is the alloy of the coin and the weight of it,\r\nhe has it in his own purse, he answers boldly, \'Yea, and so shining and\r\nround that of a surety it has the lawful stamp.\'[132] And further on,\r\nwhen required to declare in what he believes, nothing against the\r\nfulness of his creed is to be inferred from the fact that he stops short\r\nafter pronouncing his belief in the existence of God and in the Trinity.\r\nThis article he gives as implying all the others; it is \'the spark which\r\nspreads out into a vivid flame.\'[133]\r\n\r\nYet if the inquiry were to be pushed further, and it were sought to find\r\nhow much of free thought he allowed himself in matters of religion,\r\nDante might be discovered to have reached his orthodox position by ways\r\nhateful to the bigots who then took order for preserving the purity of\r\nthe faith. The office of the Pope he deeply revered, but the Papal\r\nabsolution avails nothing in his eyes compared with one tear of\r\nheartfelt repentance.[134] It is not on the word of Pope or Council that\r\nhe rests his faith, but on the Scriptures, and on the evidences of the\r\ntruth of Christianity, freely examined and weighed.[135] Chief among\r\nthese evidences, it must however be noted, he esteemed the fact of the\r\nexistence of the Church as he found it;[136] and in his inquiries he\r\naccepted as guides the Scholastic Doctors on whose reasonings the Church\r\nhad set its seal of approbation. It was a foregone conclusion he reached\r\nby stages of his own. Yet that he sympathised at least as much with the\r\nhonest search for truth as with the arrogant profession of orthodoxy, is\r\nshown by his treatment of heretics. He could not condemn severely such\r\nas erred only because their reason would not consent to rest like his in\r\nthe prevalent dogmatic system; and so we find that he makes heresy\r\nconsist less in intellectual error than in beliefs that tend to vitiate\r\nconduct, or to cause schism in societies divinely constituted.[137] For\r\nhis own part, orthodox although he was, or believed himself to be--which\r\nis all that needs to be contended for,--in no sense was he\r\npriest-ridden. It was liberty that he went seeking on his great\r\njourney;[138] and he gives no hint that it is to be gained by the\r\nobservance of forms or in submission to sacerdotal authority. He knows\r\nit is in his reach only when he has been crowned, and mitred too, lord\r\nof himself[139]--subject to Him alone of whom even Popes were\r\nservants.[140]\r\n\r\nAlthough in what were to prove his last months Dante might amuse himself\r\nwith the composition of learned trifles, and in the society and\r\ncorrespondence of men who along with him, if on lines apart from his,\r\nwere preparing the way for the revival of classical studies, the best\r\npart of his mind, then as for long before, was devoted to the _Comedy_;\r\nand he was counting on the suffrages of a wider audience than courts and\r\nuniversities could supply.\r\n\r\nHere there is no room to treat at length of that work, to which when we\r\nturn our thoughts all else he wrote--though that was enough to secure\r\nhim fame--seems to fall into the background as if unworthy of his\r\ngenius. What can hardly be passed over in silence is that in the\r\n_Comedy_, once it was begun, he must have found a refuge for his soul\r\nfrom all petty cares, and a shield against all adverse fortune. We must\r\nsearch its pages, and not the meagre records of his biographers, to find\r\nwhat was the life he lived during the years of his exile; for, in a\r\nsense, it contains the true journal of his thoughts, of his hopes, and\r\nof his sorrows. The plan was laid wide enough to embrace the\r\nobservations he made of nature and of man, the fruits of his painful\r\nstudies, and the intelligence he gathered from those experienced in\r\ntravel, politics, and war. It was not only his imagination and artistic\r\nskill that were spent upon the poem: he gave his life to it. The future\r\nreward he knew was sure--an immortal fame; but he hoped for a nearer\r\nprofit on his venture. Florence might at last relent, if not because of\r\nhis innocence and at the spectacle of his inconsolable exile, at least\r\non hearing the rumour of his genius borne to her from every corner of\r\nItaly:--\r\n\r\n  If e\'er it comes that this my sacred Lay,\r\n    To which both Heaven and Earth have set their hand--\r\n    Through which these many years I waste away--\r\n  Shall quell the cruelty that keeps me banned\r\n    From the fair fold where I, a lamb, was found\r\n    Hostile to wolves who \'gainst it violence planned;\r\n  With other fleece and voice of other sound,\r\n    Poet will I return, and at the font\r\n    Where I was christened be with laurel crowned.[141]\r\n\r\nBut with the completion of the _Comedy_ Dante\'s life too came to a\r\nclose. He died at Ravenna in the month of September 1321.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Matilda died in 1115. The name Tessa, the contraction of Contessa,\r\nwas still, long after her time, sometimes given to Florentine girls. See\r\nPerrens, _Histoire de Florence_, vol. i. p. 126.\r\n\r\n[2] Whether by Matilda the great Countess is meant has been eagerly\r\ndisputed, and many of the best critics--such as Witte and\r\nScartazzini--prefer to find in her one of the ladies of the _Vita\r\nNuova_. In spite of their pains it seems as if more can be said for the\r\ngreat Matilda than for any other. The one strong argument against her\r\nis, that while she died old, in the poem she appears as young.\r\n\r\n[3] See note on _Inferno_ xxx. 73.\r\n\r\n[4] It might, perhaps, be more correct to say that to some offices the\r\nnobles were eligible, but did not elect.\r\n\r\n[5] _Inf._ xiii. 75.\r\n\r\n[6] _Inf._ x. 119.\r\n\r\n[7] _Inf._ xxiii. 66.\r\n\r\n[8] _Inf._ x. 51.\r\n\r\n[9] _Purg._ vi. 144.\r\n\r\n[10] Dante sets the Abbot among the traitors in Inferno, and says\r\nscornfully of him that his throat was cut at Florence (_Inf._ xxxii.\r\n119).\r\n\r\n[11] Villani throws doubt on the guilt of the Abbot. There were some\r\ncases of churchmen being Ghibelines, as for instance that of the\r\nCardinal Ubaldini (_Inf._ x. 120). Twenty years before the Abbot\'s death\r\nthe General of the Franciscans had been jeered at in the streets of\r\nFlorence for turning his coat and joining the Emperor. On the other\r\nhand, many civilians were to be found among the Guelfs.\r\n\r\n[12] Manfred, says John Villani (_Cronica_, vi. 74 and 75), at first\r\nsent only a hundred men. Having by Farinata\'s advice been filled with\r\nwine before a skirmish in which they were induced to engage, they were\r\neasily cut in pieces by the Florentines; and the royal standard was\r\ndragged in the dust. The truth of the story matters less than that it\r\nwas believed in Florence.\r\n\r\n[13] Provenzano is found by Dante in Purgatory, which he has been\r\nadmitted to, in spite of his sins, because of his self-sacrificing\r\ndevotion to a friend (_Purg._ xi. 121).\r\n\r\n[14] For this good advice he gets a word of praise in Inferno (_Inf._\r\nxvi. 42).\r\n\r\n[15] These mercenaries, though called Germans, were of various races.\r\nThere were even Greeks and Saracens among them. The mixture corresponded\r\nwith the motley civilisation of Manfred\'s court.\r\n\r\n[16] _Inf._ xxxii. 79.\r\n\r\n[17] _Inf._ x. 93.\r\n\r\n[18] Lucera was a fortress which had been peopled with Saracens by\r\nFrederick.\r\n\r\n[19] Manfred, _Purg._ iii. 112; Charles, _Purg._ vii. 113.\r\n\r\n[20] _Purg._ xx. 67.\r\n\r\n[21] _Purg._ iii. 122.\r\n\r\n[22] For an account of the constitution and activity of the _Parte\r\nGuelfa_ at a later period, see Perrens, _Hist. de Florence_, vol. iv. p.\r\n482.\r\n\r\n[23] _Purg._ xx. 68.\r\n\r\n[24] _Parad._ xi. 89.\r\n\r\n[25] _Parad._ xvi. 40, etc.\r\n\r\n[26] _Inf._ xxix. 31.\r\n\r\n[27] _Inf._ x. 42. Though Dante was descended from nobles, his rank in\r\nFlorence was not that of a noble or magnate, but of a commoner.\r\n\r\n[28] The month is indicated by Dante himself, _Parad._ xxii. 110. The\r\nyear has recently been disputed. For 1265 we have J. Villani and the\r\nearliest biographers; and Dante\'s own expression at the beginning of the\r\n_Comedy_ is in favour of it.\r\n\r\n[29] _Inf._ xxiii. 95.\r\n\r\n[30] _Inf._ xix. 17; _Parad._ xxv. 9.\r\n\r\n[31] _Purg._ xxx. 55.\r\n\r\n[32] _Inf._ viii. 45, where Virgil says of Dante that blessed was she\r\nthat bore him, can scarcely be regarded as an exception to this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n[33] In 1326, out of a population of ninety thousand, from eight to ten\r\nthousand children were being taught to read; and from five to six\r\nhundred were being taught grammar and logic in four high schools. There\r\nwas not in Dante\'s time, or till much later, a University in Florence.\r\nSee J. Villani, xi. 94, and Burckhardt, _Cultur der Renaissance_, vol.\r\ni. p. 76.\r\n\r\n[34] For an interesting account of Heresy in Florence from the eleventh\r\nto the thirteenth centuries, see Perrens, _Hist. de Florence_, vol. i.\r\nlivre ii. chap. iii.\r\n\r\n[35] It opens with Brunetto\'s being lost in the forest of Roncesvalles,\r\nand there are some other features of resemblance--all on the\r\nsurface--between his experience and Dante\'s.\r\n\r\n[36] G. Villani, viii. 10. Latini died in 1294. Villani gives the old\r\nscholar a very bad moral character.\r\n\r\n[37] _Inf._ xv. 84.\r\n\r\n[38] We may, I think, assume the _Vita Nuova_ to have been published\r\nsome time between 1291 and 1300; but the dates of Dante\'s works are far\r\nfrom being ascertained.\r\n\r\n[39] So long as even Italian critics are not agreed as to whether the\r\ntitle means _New Life_, or _Youth_, I suppose one is free to take his\r\nchoice; and it seems most natural to regard it as referring to the new\r\nworld into which the lover is transported by his passion.\r\n\r\n[40] As, indeed, Boccaccio, _Vita di Dante_, expressly says was the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[41] In this adopting a device frequently used by the love-poets of the\r\nperiod.--Witte, _Dante-Forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 312.\r\n\r\n[42] The _Vita Nuova_ contains some thirty poems.\r\n\r\n[43] See Sir Theodore Martin\'s Introduction to his Translation of _Vita\r\nNuova_, page xxi.\r\n\r\n[44] In this matter we must not judge the conduct of Dante by English\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\n[45] _Donne, ch\' avete intelletto d\' amore_: Ladies that are acquainted\r\nwell with love. Quoted in _Purg._ xxiv. 51.\r\n\r\n[46] Beatrice died in June 1290, having been born in April 1266.\r\n\r\n[47] _Purg._ xi. 98.\r\n\r\n[48] _Purg._ xxiv. 52.\r\n\r\n[49] The date of the _Convito_ is still the subject of controversy, as\r\nis that of most of Dante\'s works. But it certainly was composed between\r\nthe _Vita Nuova_ and the _Comedy_.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable sonnet by Guido Cavalcanti addressed to Dante,\r\nreproaching him for the deterioration in his thoughts and habits, and\r\nurging him to rid himself of the woman who has bred the trouble. This\r\nmay refer to the time after the death of Beatrice. See also _Purg._ xxx.\r\n124.\r\n\r\n[50] _Convito_ ii. 13.\r\n\r\n[51] Some recent writers set his marriage five years later, and reduce\r\nthe number of his children to three.\r\n\r\n[52] His sister is probably meant by the \'young and gentle lady, most\r\nnearly related to him by blood\' mentioned in the _Vita Nuova_.\r\n\r\n[53] The difference between the Teutonic and Southern conception of\r\nmarriage must be kept in mind.\r\n\r\n[54] He describes the weather on the day of the battle with the\r\nexactness of one who had been there (_Purg._ v. 155).\r\n\r\n[55] Leonardo Bruni.\r\n\r\n[56] _Inf._ xxii. 4.\r\n\r\n[57] _Inf._ xxi. 95.\r\n\r\n[58] _Conv._ iii. 9, where he illustrates what he has to say about the\r\nnature of vision, by telling that for some time the stars, when he\r\nlooked at them, seemed lost in a pearly haze.\r\n\r\n[59] The _Convito_ was to have consisted of fifteen books. Only four\r\nwere written.\r\n\r\n[60] _Wife of Bath\'s Tale._ In the context he quotes _Purg._ vii. 121,\r\nand takes ideas from the _Convito_.\r\n\r\n[61] Dies to sensual pleasure and is abstracted from all worldly affairs\r\nand interests.

But doubt has been thrown on\r\nthe authenticity of the deed of abolition. See Perrens, _Hist. de\r\nFlorence_, vol. ii. p. 349.\r\n\r\n[73] No unusual provision in the industrious Italian cities. Harsh\r\nthough it may seem, it was probably regarded as a valuable concession to\r\nthe nobles, for their disaffection appears to have been greatly caused\r\nby their uneasiness under disabilities. There is much obscurity on\r\nseveral points. How, for example, came the nobles to be allowed to\r\nretain the command of the vast resources of the _Parte Guelfa_? This\r\nmade them almost independent of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[74] At a later period the Priors were known as the Signory.\r\n\r\n[75] Fraticelli, _Storia della Vita di Dante_, page 112 and note.\r\n\r\n[76] It is to be regretted that Amp\xc3\xa8re in his charming _Voyage\r\nDantesque_ devoted no chapter to San Gemigniano, than which no Tuscan\r\ncity has more thoroughly preserved its medi\xc3\xa6val character. There is no\r\nauthority for the assertion that Dante was employed on several\r\nFlorentine embassies. The tendency of his early biographers is to\r\nexaggerate his political importance and activity.\r\n\r\n[77] Under the date of April 1301 Dante is deputed by the Road Committee\r\nto see to the widening, levelling, and general improvement of a street\r\nin the suburbs.--Witte, _Dante-Forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 279.\r\n\r\n[78] Dante has a word of praise for Giano, at _Parad._ xvi. 127.\r\n\r\n[79] At which Dante fought. See page lxii.\r\n\r\n[80] Vieri was called Messer, a title reserved for magnates, knights,\r\nand lawyers of a certain rank--notaries and jurisconsults; Dante, for\r\nexample, never gets it.\r\n\r\n[81] Villani acted for some time as an agent abroad of the great\r\nbusiness house of Peruzzi.\r\n\r\n[82] _Inf._ iii. 60.\r\n\r\n[83] He is \'the Prince of the modern Pharisees\' (_Inf._ xxvii. 85); his\r\nplace is ready for him in hell (_Inf._ xix. 53); and he is elsewhere\r\nfrequently referred to. In one great passage Dante seems to relent\r\ntowards him (_Purg._ xx. 86).\r\n\r\n[84] Albert of Hapsburg was chosen Emperor in 1298, but was never\r\ncrowned at Rome.\r\n\r\n[85] As in the days of Guelf and Ghibeline, so now in those of Blacks\r\nand Whites, the common multitude of townsmen belonged to neither party.\r\n\r\n[86] An interdict means that priests are to refuse sacred offices to all\r\nin the community, who are thus virtually subjected to the minor\r\nexcommunication.\r\n\r\n[87] Guido died soon after his return in 1301. He had suffered in health\r\nduring his exile. See _Inf._ x. 63.\r\n\r\n[88] Charles of Anjou had lost Sicily at the Sicilian Vespers, 1282.\r\n\r\n[89] _Purg._ xx. 76.\r\n\r\n[90] Witte attributes the composition of the _De Monarchia_ to a period\r\nbefore 1301 (_Dante-Forschungen_, vol. i. Fourth Art.), but the general\r\nopinion of critics sets it much later.\r\n\r\n[91] _Inf._ vi. 66, where their expulsion is prophesied.\r\n\r\n[92] Dante\'s authorship of the letter is now much questioned. The drift\r\nof recent inquiries has been rather to lessen than to swell the bulk of\r\nmaterials for his biography.\r\n\r\n[93] _Parad._ xvii. 61.\r\n\r\n[94] _Purg._ xxiv. 82.\r\n\r\n[95] See at _Purg._ xx. 43 Dante\'s invective against Philip and the\r\nCapets in general.\r\n\r\n[96] Henry had come to Italy with the Pope\'s approval. He was crowned by\r\nthe Cardinals who were in Rome as Legates.\r\n\r\n[97] _Parad._ xxx. 136. High in Heaven Dante sees an ample chair with a\r\ncrown on it, and is told it is reserved for Henry. He is to sit among\r\nthose who are clothed in white. The date assigned to the action of the\r\n_Comedy_, it will be remembered, is the year 1300.\r\n\r\n[98] _Inf._ xix. 82, where the Gascon Clement is described as a \'Lawless\r\nPastor from the West.\'\r\n\r\n[99] The ingenious speculations of Troya (_Del Veltro Allegorico di\r\nDante_) will always mark a stage in the history of the study of Dante,\r\nbut as is often the case with books on the subject, his shows a\r\nconsiderable gap between the evidence adduced and the conclusions drawn\r\nfrom it. He would make Dante to have been for many years a satellite of\r\nthe great Ghibeline chief. Dante\'s temper or pride, however we call it,\r\nseems to have been such as to preserve him from ever remaining attached\r\nfor long to any patron.\r\n\r\n[100] _Inf._ x. 81.\r\n\r\n[101] The _Convito_ is in Italian, and his words are: \'wherever this\r\nlanguage is spoken.\'\r\n\r\n[102] His letter to the Florentines and that to the Emperor are dated in\r\n1311, from \'Near the sources of the Arno\'--that is, from the Casentino,\r\nwhere the Guidi of Romena dwelt. If the letter of condolence with the\r\nCounts Oberto and Guido of Romena on the death of their uncle is\r\ngenuine, it has great value for the passage in which he excuses himself\r\nfor not having come to the funeral:--\'It was not negligence or\r\ningratitude, but the poverty into which I am fallen by reason of my\r\nexile. This, like a cruel persecutor, holds me as in a prison-house\r\nwhere I have neither horse nor arms; and though I do all I can to free\r\nmyself, I have failed as yet.\' The letter has no date. Like the other\r\nten or twelve epistles attributed to Dante, it is in Latin.\r\n\r\n[103] There is a splendid passage in praise of this family, _Purg._\r\nviii. 121. A treaty is on record in which Dante acts as representative\r\nof the Malaspini in settling the terms of a peace between them and the\r\nBishop of Luni in October 1306.\r\n\r\n[104] The authority for this is Benvenuto of Imola in his comment on the\r\n_Comedy_ (_Purg._ xi.). The portrait of Dante by Giotto, still in\r\nFlorence, but ruined by modern bungling restoration, is usually believed\r\nto have been executed in 1301 or 1302. But with regard to this, see the\r\nnote at the end of this essay.\r\n\r\n[105] It is true that Villani not only says that \'he went to study at\r\nBologna,\' but also that \'he went to Paris and many parts of the world\'\r\n(_Cronica_, ix. 136), and that Villani, of all contemporary or nearly\r\ncontemporary writers, is by far the most worthy of credence. But he\r\nproves to be more than once in error regarding Dante; making him,\r\n_e.g._, die in a wrong month and be buried in a wrong church at Ravenna.\r\nAnd the \'many parts of the world\' shows that here he is dealing in\r\nhearsay of the vaguest sort. Nor can much weight be given to Boccaccio\r\nwhen he sends Dante to Bologna and Paris. But Benvenuto of Imola, who\r\nlectured on the _Comedy_ at Bologna within fifty years of Dante\'s death,\r\nsays that Dante studied there. It would indeed be strange if he did not,\r\nand at more than one period, Bologna being the University nearest\r\nFlorence. Proof of Dante\'s residence in Paris has been found in his\r\nfamiliar reference to the Rue du Fouarre (_Parad._ x. 137). His graphic\r\ndescription of the coast between Lerici and Turbia (_Purg._ iii. 49, iv.\r\n25) certainly seems to show a familiarity with the Western as well as\r\nthe Eastern Rivieras of Genoa. But it scarcely follows that he was on\r\nhis way to Paris when he visited them.\r\n\r\n[106] _Inf._ xiii. 58.\r\n\r\n[107] \'O ye, who have hitherto been following me in some small\r\ncraft, ... put not further to sea, lest, losing sight of me, you lose\r\nyourselves\' (_Parad._ ii. 1). But, to tell the truth, Dante is never so\r\nweak as a poet as when he is most the philosopher or the theologian.\r\nThe following list of books more or less known to him is not given as\r\ncomplete:--The Vulgate, beginning with St. Jerome\'s Prologue; Aristotle,\r\nthrough the Latin translation then in vogue; Averroes, etc.; Thomas\r\nAquinas and the other Schoolmen; much of the Civil and Canon law;\r\nBoethius; Homer only in scraps, through Aristotle, etc.; Virgil, Cicero\r\nin part, Livy, Horace, Ovid, Terence, Lucan, and Statius; the works of\r\nBrunetto Latini; the poetical literature of Provence, France, and Italy,\r\nincluding the Arthurian Romances--the favourite reading of the Italian\r\nnobles, and the tales of Charlemagne and his Peers--equally in favour\r\nwith the common people. There is little reason to suppose that among the\r\ntreatises of a scientific and quasi-scientific kind that he fell in\r\nwith, and of which he was an eager student, were included the works of\r\nRoger Bacon. These there was a conspiracy among priests and schoolmen to\r\nkeep buried. Dante seems to have set little store on ecclesiastical\r\nlegends of wonder; at least he gives them a wide berth in his works.\r\n\r\n[108] In the notes to Fraticelli\'s _Vita di Dante_ (Florence 1861) are\r\ngiven copies of documents relating to the property of the Alighieri, and\r\nof Dante in particular. In 1343 his son Jacopo, by payment of a small\r\nfine, recovered vineyards and farms that had been his father\'s.--Notes\r\nto Chap. iii. Fraticelli\'s admirable Life is now in many respects out of\r\ndate. He accepts, _e.g._, Dino Compagni as an authority, and believes in\r\nthe romantic story of the letter of Fra Ilario.\r\n\r\n[109] The details are given by Witte, _Dante-Forschungen_, vol ii. p.\r\n61. The amount borrowed by Dante and his brother (and a friend) comes to\r\nnearly a thousand gold florins. Witte takes this as equivalent to 37,000\r\nfrancs, _i.e._ nearly \xc2\xa31500. But the florin being the eighth of an\r\nounce, or about ten shillings\' worth of gold, a thousand florins would\r\nbe equal only to \xc2\xa3500--representing, of course, an immensely greater sum\r\nnow-a-days.\r\n\r\n[110] _Purg._ viii. 76.\r\n\r\n[111] See in Scartazzini, _Dante Alighieri_, 1879, page 552, extract\r\nfrom the will of her mother Maria Donati, dated February 1314. Many of\r\nthese Florentine dates are subject to correction, the year being usually\r\ncounted from Lady-Day. \'In 1880 a document was discovered which proves\r\nGemma to have been engaged in a law-suit in 1332.--_Il Propugnatore_,\r\nxiii^a. 156,\'--Scheffer-Boichorst, _Aus Dantes Verbannung_, page 213.\r\n\r\n[112] _Purg._ xxiv. 37.\r\n\r\n[113] _Inf._ xxi. 40.\r\n\r\n[114] _In questo mirifico poeta trov\xc3\xb2 ampissimo luego la lussuria; e non\r\nsolamente ne\' giovanili anni, ma ancora ne\' maturi._--Boccaccio, _La\r\nVita di Dante_. After mentioning that Dante was married, he indulges in\r\na long invective against marriage; confessing, however, that he is\r\nignorant of whether Dante experienced the miseries he describes. His\r\nconclusion on the subject is that philosophers should leave marriage to\r\nrich fools, to nobles, and to handicraftsmen.\r\n\r\n[115] In Purgatory his conscience accuses him of pride, and he already\r\nseems to feel the weight of the grievous burden beneath which the proud\r\nbend as they purge themselves of their sin (_Purg._ xiii. 136). Some\r\namount of self-accusation seems to be implied in such passages as\r\n_Inf._, v. 142 and _Purg._ xxvii. 15, etc.; but too much must not be\r\nmade of it.\r\n\r\n[116] In a letter of a few lines to one of the Marquises Malaspina,\r\nwritten probably in the earlier years of his exile, he tells how his\r\npurpose of renouncing ladies\' society and the writing of love-songs had\r\nbeen upset by the view of a lady of marvellous beauty who \'in all\r\nrespects answered to his tastes, habits, and circumstances.\' He says he\r\nsends with the letter a poem containing a fuller account of his\r\nsubjection to this new passion. The poem is not found attached to the\r\ncopy of the letter, but with good reason it is guessed to be the Canzone\r\nbeginning _Amor, dacch\xc3\xa8 convien_, which describes how he was\r\novermastered by a passion born \'in the heart of the mountains in the\r\nvalley of that river beside which he had always been the victim of\r\nlove.\' This points to the Casentino as the scene. He also calls the\r\nCanzone his \'mountain song.\' The passion it expresses may be real, but\r\nthat he makes the most of it appears from the close, which is occupied\r\nby the thought of how the verses will be taken in Florence.\r\n\r\n[117] However early the _De Monarchia_ may have been written, it is\r\ndifficult to think that it can be of a later date than the death of\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\n[118] The _De Vulgari Eloquio_ is in Latin. Dante\'s own Italian is\r\nricher and more elastic than that of contemporary writers. Its base is\r\nthe Tuscan dialect, as refined by the example of the Sicilian poets. His\r\nLatin, on the contrary, is I believe regarded as being somewhat\r\nbarbarous, even for the period.\r\n\r\n[119] In his _Qu\xc3\xa6stio de Aqua et Terra_. In it he speaks of having been\r\nin Mantua. The thesis was maintained in Verona, but of course he may,\r\nafter a prolonged absence, have returned to that city.\r\n\r\n[120] _Parad._ xvii. 70.\r\n\r\n[121] _Purg._ xviii. 121.\r\n\r\n[122] But in urgent need of more of it.--He says of \'the sublime\r\nCantica, adorned with the title of the _Paradiso_\', that \'_illam sub\r\npr\xc3\xa6senti epistola, tamquam sub epigrammate proprio dedicatam, vobis\r\nadscribo, vobis offero, vobis denique recommendo_.\' But it may be\r\nquestioned if this involves that the Cantica was already finished.\r\n\r\n[123] As, for instance, Herr Scheffer-Boichorst in his _Aus Dantes\r\nVerbannung_, 1882.\r\n\r\n[124] The Traversari (_Purg._ xiv. 107). Guido\'s wife was of the\r\nBagnacavalli (_Purg._ xiv. 115). The only mention of the Polenta family,\r\napart from that of Francesca, is at _Inf._ xxvii. 41.\r\n\r\n[125] In 1350 a sum of ten gold florins was sent from Florence by the\r\nhands of Boccaccio to Beatrice, daughter of Dante; she being then a nun\r\nat Ravenna.\r\n\r\n[126] The embassy to Venice is mentioned by Villani, and there was a\r\ntreaty concluded in 1321 between the Republic and Guido. But Dante\'s\r\nname does not appear in it among those of the envoys from Ravenna. A\r\nletter, probably apocryphal, to Guido from Dante in Venice is dated\r\n1314. If Dante, as is maintained by some writers, was engaged in tuition\r\nwhile in Ravenna, it is to be feared that his pupils would find in him\r\nan impatient master.\r\n\r\n[127] Not that Dante ever mentions these any more than a hundred other\r\nchurches in which he must have spent thoughtful hours.\r\n\r\n[128] _Purg._ xxviii. 20.\r\n\r\n[129] A certain Cecco d\'Ascoli stuck to him like a bur, charging him,\r\namong other things, with lust, and a want of religious faith which would\r\none day secure him a place in his own Inferno. Cecco was himself burned\r\nin Florence, in 1327, for making too much of evil spirits, and holding\r\nthat human actions are necessarily affected by the position of the\r\nstars. He had been at one time a professor of astronomy.\r\n\r\n[130] Gabriel Rossetti, _Comment on the Divina Commedia_, 1826, and\r\nAroux, _Dante, H\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9tique, R\xc3\xa9volutionnaire et Socialiste_, 1854.\r\n\r\n[131] Scartazzini, _Dante Alighieri, Seine Zeit_, etc., 1879, page 268.\r\n\r\n[132] _Parad._ xxiv. 86.\r\n\r\n[133] _Parad._ xxiv. 145.\r\n\r\n[134] _Inf._ xxvii. 101; _Purg._ iii. 118.\r\n\r\n[135] _Parad._ xxiv. 91.\r\n\r\n[136] _Parad._ xxiv. 106.\r\n\r\n[137] _Inf._ x. and xxviii.

Writers of an earlier date had already\r\ndrawn attention to this work.[143] But in the course of an age when\r\nItalians cared little for Dante, and less for Giotto, it was allowed to\r\nbe buried out of sight; and when at length there came a revival of\r\nesteem for these great men, the alterations in the interior arrangement\r\nof the palace were found to have been so sweeping that it was even\r\nuncertain which out of many chambers had formerly served as the chapel.\r\nTwenty years after a fruitless attempt had been made to discover whether\r\nor not the portrait was still in existence, Signor Aubrey Bezzi,\r\nencouraged by Mr. Wilde and Mr. Kirkup, took the first step in a search\r\n(1839) which was to end by restoring to the world what is certainly the\r\nmost interesting of all portraits, if account be taken of its beauty,\r\nas well as of who was its author and who its subject.\r\n\r\nOn the removal from it of a layer of lime, one of the end walls of what\r\nhad been the chapel was found to be covered by a fresco painting,\r\nevidently the work of Giotto, and representing a Paradise--the subject\r\nin which Dante\'s portrait was known to occur. As is usual in such works,\r\nfrom the time of Giotto downwards, the subject is treated so as to allow\r\nof the free introduction of contemporary personages. Among these was a\r\nfigure in a red gown, which there was no difficulty in recognising as\r\nthe portrait of Dante. It shows him younger and with a sweeter\r\nexpression than does Raphael\'s Dante, or Masaccio\'s,[144] or that in the\r\nCathedral of Florence,[145] or that of the mask said to have been taken\r\nafter his death. But to all of them it bears a strong resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe question of when this portrait was painted will easily be seen to be\r\none of much importance in connection with Dante\'s biography. The fresco\r\nit belongs to is found to contain a cardinal, and a young man, who,\r\nbecause he wears his hair long and has a coronet set on his cap, is\r\nknown to be meant for a French prince.[146] If, as is usually assumed,\r\nthis prince is Charles of Valois, then the date of the event celebrated\r\nin the fresco is 1301 or 1302. With regard to when the work was\r\nexecuted, Messrs Crowe and Cavalcaselle, in their valuable book, say as\r\nfollows:[147]--\r\n\r\n    \'All inferences to be deduced from the subject and form of these\r\n    frescos point to the date of 1301-2. It may be inquired whether\r\n    they were executed by Giotto at the time, and this inquiry can only\r\n    be satisfied approximatively. It may be inferred that Dante\'s\r\n    portrait would hardly have been introduced into a picture so\r\n    conspicuously visible as this, had not the poet at the time been\r\n    influent in Florence.... Dante\'s age in the fresco corresponds with\r\n    the date of 1302, and is that of a man of thirty-five. He had\r\n    himself enjoyed the highest office of Florence from June to August\r\n    1300.[148] In the fresco he does not wear the dress of the\r\n    "Priori," but he holds in the ranks of those near Charles of Valois\r\n    an honourable place. It may be presumed that the frescos were\r\n    executed previous[149] to Dante\'s exile, and this view is confirmed\r\n    by the technical and artistic progress which they reveal. They\r\n    exhibit, indeed, the master in a higher sphere of development than\r\n    at Assisi and Rome.\'\r\n\r\nThis account of the subject of the work and the probable date of its\r\nexecution may, I think, be accepted as containing all that is to be said\r\nin favour of the current opinion on the matter. That writer after writer\r\nhas adopted that opinion without a sign of doubt as to its credibility\r\nmust surely have arisen from failure to observe the insuperable\r\ndifficulties it presents.\r\n\r\nBoth Charles of Valois and the Cardinal Acquasparta were in Florence\r\nduring part of the winter of 1301-1302; but the circumstances under\r\nwhich they were there make it highly improbable that the Commonwealth\r\nwas anxious to do them honour beyond granting them the outward show of\r\nrespect which it would have been dangerous to refuse. Earlier in the\r\nyear 1301 the Cardinal Acquasparta, having failed in gaining the object\r\nwhich brought him to Florence, had, as it were, shaken the dust of the\r\ncity from off his feet and left the people of it under interdict. While\r\nCharles of Valois was in Florence the Cardinal returned to make a second\r\nattempt to reconcile the opposing parties, failed a second time, and\r\nagain left the city under an interdict--if indeed the first had ever\r\nbeen raised. On the occasion of his first visit, the Whites, who were\r\nthen in power, would have none of his counsels; on his second, the\r\nBlacks in their turn despised them.[150] There would therefore have been\r\nsomething almost satirical in the compliment, had the Commonwealth\r\nresolved to give him a place in a triumphal picture.\r\n\r\nAs for Charles of Valois, though much was expected from an alliance with\r\nhim while he was still at a distance, the very party that invited his\r\npresence was soon disgusted with him owing to his faithlessness and\r\ngreed. The earlier part of his stay was disturbed by pillage and\r\nbloodshed. Nor is it easy to imagine how, at any time during his\r\nresidence of five months, the leading citizens could have either the\r\ntime or the wish to arrange for honouring him in a fashion he was not\r\nthe man to care for. His one craving was for money, and still more\r\nmoney; and any leisure the members of public bodies had to spare from\r\ngiving heed to their own interests and securing vengeance upon their\r\nopponents, was devoted to holding the common purse shut as tightly as\r\nthey could against their avaricious Pacificator. When he at last\r\ndelivered the city from his presence no one would have the heart to\r\nrevive the memory of his disastrous visit.\r\n\r\nBut if, in all this confusion of Florentine affairs, Giotto did receive\r\na commission to paint in the palace of the Podesta, yet it remains\r\nincredible that he should have been suffered to assign to Dante, of all\r\nmen, a place of honour in the picture. No citizen had more stubbornly\r\nopposed the policy which brought Charles of Valois to Florence, and that\r\nCharles was in the city was reason enough for Dante to keep out of it.\r\nIn his absence, he was sentenced in January 1302 to pay a ruinously\r\nheavy fine, and in the following March he was condemned to be put to\r\ndeath if ever he was caught. On fuller acquaintance his fellow-citizens\r\nliked the Frenchman as little as he, but this had no effect in softening\r\ntheir dislike or removing their fear of Dante. We may be sure that any\r\nfriends he may still have had in Florence, as their influence could not\r\nprotect his goods from confiscation or him from banishment, would hardly\r\ncare to risk their own safety by urging, while his condemnation was\r\nstill fresh, the admission of his portrait among those of illustrious\r\nFlorentines.[151] It is true that there have been instances of great\r\nartists having reached so high a pitch of fame as to be able to dictate\r\nterms to patrons, however exalted. In his later years Giotto could\r\nperhaps have made such a point a matter of treaty with his employers,\r\nbut in 1301 he was still young,[152] and great although his fame already\r\nwas, he could scarcely have ventured to insist on the Republic\'s\r\nconfessing its injustice to his friend; as it would have done had it\r\nconsented that Dante, newly driven into exile, should obtain a place of\r\nhonour in a work painted at the public cost.\r\n\r\nThese considerations seem to make it highly improbable that Giotto\'s\r\nwall-painting was meant to do honour to Charles of Valois and the\r\nCardinal Acquasparta. But if it should still be held that it was painted\r\nin 1302, we must either cease to believe, in spite of all that Vasari\r\nand the others say, that the portrait is meant for Dante; or else\r\nconfess it to be inexplicable how it got there. A way out of the\r\ndifficulty begins to open up as soon as we allow ourselves some latitude\r\nin speculating as to when Giotto may have painted the fresco. The order\r\nin which that artist\'s works were produced is very imperfectly settled;\r\nand it may easily be that the position in Vasari\'s pages of the mention\r\nmade by him of this fresco has given rise to a misunderstanding\r\nregarding the date of it. He speaks of it at the very beginning of his\r\nLife of Giotto. But this he does because he needs an illustration of\r\nwhat he has been saying in his opening sentences about the advance that\r\npainter made on Cimabue. Only after making mention of Dante\'s portrait\r\ndoes he begin his chronological list of Giotto\'s works; to the portrait\r\nhe never returns, and so, as far as Vasari is concerned, it is without a\r\ndate. Judging of it by means of Mr. Kirkup\'s careful and beautiful\r\nsketch--and unfortunately we have now no other means of knowing what the\r\noriginal was like--it may safely be asserted to be in Giotto\'s ripest\r\nstyle.[153] Everything considered, it is therefore allowable to search\r\nthe Florentine chronicles lower down for an event more likely to be the\r\nsubject of Giotto\'s fresco than that usually fixed upon.\r\n\r\nWe read in John Villani that in the middle of the year 1326 the Cardinal\r\nGianni Orsini came to Florence as Papal Legate and Pacificator of\r\nTuscany. The city was greatly pleased at his coming, and as an earnest\r\nof gratitude for his services presented him with a cup containing a\r\nthousand florins.[154] A month later there arrived Charles Duke of\r\nCalabria, the eldest son of King Robert of Naples, and great-grandson of\r\nCharles of Anjou. He came as Protector of the Commonwealth, which\r\noffice--an extraordinary one, and with a great salary attached to it--he\r\nhad been elected to hold for five years. Never before had a spectacle\r\nlike that of his entry been offered to Florence. Villani gives a long\r\nlist of the barons who rode in his train, and tells that in his\r\nsquadrons of men-at-arms there were no fewer than two hundred knights.\r\nThe chronicler pauses to bid the reader note how great an enterprise his\r\nfellow-citizens had shown in bringing to sojourn among them, and in\r\ntheir interest, not only such a powerful lord as the Duke of Calabria\r\nwas, but a Papal Legate as well. Italy counted it a great thing, he\r\nsays, and he deems that the whole world ought to know of it.[155]\r\nCharles took up his abode in the Podesta\'s palace. He appears to have\r\ngained a better place in the hearts of the Florentines than what they\r\nwere used to give to strangers and princes. When a son was born to him,\r\nall the city rejoiced, and it mourned with him when, in a few weeks, he\r\nlost the child. After seventeen months\' experience of his rule the\r\ncitizens were sorry to lose him, and bade him a farewell as hearty as\r\ntheir welcome had been. To some of them, it is true, the policy seemed a\r\ndangerous one which bore even the appearance of subjecting the Republic\r\nto the Royal House of Naples; and some of them could have wished that he\r\n\'had shown more vigour in civil and military affairs. But he was a\r\ngentle lord, popular with the townsfolk, and in the course of his\r\nresidence he greatly improved the condition of things in Florence, and\r\nbrought to a close many feuds.\'[156] They felt that the nine hundred\r\nthousand gold florins spent on him and his men had, on the whole, been\r\nwell laid out.\r\n\r\nOne detail of the Duke\'s personal appearance deserves remark. We have\r\nseen that the prince in the fresco has long hair. John Villani had known\r\nthe Duke well by sight, and when he comes to record his death and\r\ndescribe what kind of man he was to look upon, he specially says that\r\n\'he wore his hair loose.\'[157]\r\n\r\nA subject worthy of Giotto\'s pencil, and one likely to be offered to him\r\nif he was then in Florence, we have therefore found in this visit of the\r\nDuke and the Cardinal. But that Giotto was in Florence at that time is\r\ncertain. He painted a portrait[158] of the Duke in the Palace of the\r\nSignory; and through that prince, as Vasari tells, he was invited by\r\nKing Robert to go down to work in Naples. All this, in the absence of\r\nevidence of any value in favour of another date, makes it, at the very\r\nleast, highly probable that the fresco was a work of 1326 or 1327.\r\n\r\nIn 1326 Dante had been dead for five years. The grudge his\r\nfellow-townsmen had nourished against him for so long was now worn out.\r\nWe know that very soon after his death Florence began to be proud of\r\nhim; and even such of his old enemies as still survived would be willing\r\nthat Giotto should set him in a place of honour among the great\r\nFlorentines who help to fill the fresco of the Paradise. That he was\r\nalready dead would be no hindrance to his finding room alongside of\r\nCharles of Calabria; for the age was wisely tolerant of such\r\nanachronisms.[159] Had Dante been still living the painter would have\r\nbeen less at liberty to create, out of the records he doubtless\r\npossessed of the features of the friend who had paid him beforehand with\r\none immortal line, the face which, as we look into it, we feel to be a\r\nglorified transcript of what it was in the flesh. It is the face of one\r\nwho has wellnigh forgotten his earthly life, instead of having the worst\r\nof it still before him; of one who, from that troubled Italy which like\r\nhis own Sapia he knew but as a pilgrim, has passed to the \'true city,\'\r\nof which he remains for evermore a citizen--the city faintly imaged by\r\nGiotto upon the chapel wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[142] It is best known, and can now be judged of only through the\r\nlithograph after a tracing made by Mr. Seymour Kirkup before it was\r\nrestored and ruined: published by the Arundel Society.\r\n\r\n[143] Antonio Pucci, born in 1300, in his _Centiloquio_, describes the\r\nfigure of Dante as being clothed in blood-red. Philip Villani also\r\nmentions it. He wrote towards the close of the fourteenth century;\r\nVasari towards the middle of the sixteenth.\r\n\r\n[144] In the Munich collection of drawings, and ascribed to Masaccio,\r\nbut with how much reason I do not know.\r\n\r\n[145] Painted by Domenico Michelino in 1465, after a sketch by Alessio\r\nBaldovinetto.\r\n\r\n[146] \'Wearing over the long hair of the Frenchmen of the period a\r\ncoroneted cap.\'--Crowe and Cavalcaselle, _History of Painting in Italy_\r\n(1864), i. 264.\r\n\r\n[147] Vol. i. p. 269.\r\n\r\n[148] The Priorate was the highest office to which a citizen could\r\naspire, but by no means the highest in Florence.\r\n\r\n[149] I suppose the meaning is \'immediately previous.\'\r\n\r\n[150] John Villani, _Cronica_, viii. 40 and 49; and Perrens, _Hist. de\r\nFlorence_, under date of 1301.

Villani says that along with Dante Giotto\r\npainted Corso Donati and Brunetto Latini.\r\n\r\n[152] Only twenty-five, if the commonly accepted date of his birth is\r\ncorrect. In any case, he was still a young man.\r\n\r\n[153] It is true that, on technical grounds, it has been questioned if\r\nit is Giotto\'s at all; but there is more than sufficient reason to think\r\nit is. With such doubts however we are scarcely here concerned. Even\r\nwere it proved to be by a pupil, everything in the text that applies to\r\nthe question of date would still remain in point.\r\n\r\n[154] J. Villani, ix. 353.\r\n\r\n[155] J.

But ere I tell\r\n    At large of good which there by me was found,\r\n    I will relate what other things befell.\r\n  Scarce know I how I entered on that ground,                       10\r\n    So deeply, at the moment when I passed\r\n    From the right way, was I in slumber drowned.\r\n  But when beneath a hill[162] arrived at last,\r\n    Which for the boundary of the valley stood,\r\n    That with such terror had my heart harassed,\r\n  I upwards looked and saw its shoulders glowed,\r\n    Radiant already with that planet\'s[163] light\r\n    Which guideth surely upon every road.\r\n  A little then was quieted by the sight\r\n    The fear which deep within my heart had lain                    20\r\n    Through all my sore experience of the night.\r\n  And as the man, who, breathing short in pain,\r\n    Hath \'scaped the sea and struggled to the shore,\r\n    Turns back to gaze upon the perilous main;\r\n  Even so my soul which fear still forward bore\r\n    Turned to review the pass whence I egressed,\r\n    And which none, living, ever left before.\r\n  My wearied frame refreshed with scanty rest,\r\n    I to ascend the lonely hill essayed;\r\n    The lower foot[164] still that on which I pressed.              30\r\n  And lo! ere I had well beginning made,\r\n    A nimble leopard,[165] light upon her feet,\r\n    And in a skin all spotted o\'er arrayed:\r\n  Nor ceased she e\'er me full in the face to meet,\r\n    And to me in my path such hindrance threw\r\n    That many a time I wheeled me to retreat.\r\n  It was the hour of dawn; with retinue\r\n    Of stars[166] that were with him when Love Divine\r\n    In the beginning into motion drew\r\n  Those beauteous things, the sun began to shine;                   40\r\n    And I took heart to be of better cheer\r\n    Touching the creature with the gaudy skin,\r\n  Seeing \'twas morn,[167] and spring-tide of the year;\r\n    Yet not so much but that when into sight\r\n    A lion[168] came, I was disturbed with fear.\r\n  Towards me he seemed advancing in his might,\r\n    Rabid with hunger and with head high thrown:\r\n    The very air was tremulous with fright.\r\n  A she-wolf,[169] too, beheld I further on;\r\n    All kinds of lust seemed in her leanness pent:                  50\r\n    Through her, ere now, much folk have misery known.\r\n  By her oppressed, and altogether spent\r\n    By the terror breathing from her aspect fell,\r\n    I lost all hope of making the ascent.\r\n  And as the man who joys while thriving well,\r\n    When comes the time to lose what he has won\r\n    In all his thoughts weeps inconsolable,\r\n  So mourned I through the brute which rest knows none:\r\n    She barred my way again and yet again,\r\n    And thrust me back where silent is the sun.                     60\r\n  And as I downward rushed to reach the plain,\r\n    Before mine eyes appeared there one aghast,\r\n    And dumb like those that silence long maintain.\r\n  When I beheld him in the desert vast,\r\n    \'Whate\'er thou art, or ghost or man,\' I cried,\r\n    \'I pray thee show such pity as thou hast.\'\r\n  \'No man,[170] though once I was; on either side\r\n    Lombard my parents were, and both of them\r\n    For native place had Mantua,\' he replied.\r\n  \'Though late, _sub Julio_,[171] to the world I came,              70\r\n    And lived at Rome in good Augustus\' day,\r\n    While yet false gods and lying were supreme.\r\n  Poet I was, renowning in my lay\r\n    Anchises\' righteous son, who fled from Troy\r\n    What time proud Ilion was to flames a prey.\r\n  But thou, why going back to such annoy?\r\n    The hill delectable why fear to mount,\r\n    The origin and ground of every joy?\'\r\n  \'And thou in sooth art Virgil, and the fount\r\n    Whence in a stream so full doth language flow?\'                 80\r\n    Abashed, I answered him with humble front.\r\n  \'Of other poets light and honour thou!\r\n    Let the long study and great zeal I\'ve shown\r\n    In searching well thy book, avail me now!\r\n  My master thou, and author[172] thou, alone!\r\n    From thee alone I, borrowing, could attain\r\n    The style[173] consummate which has made me known.\r\n  Behold the beast which makes me turn again:\r\n    Deliver me from her, illustrious Sage;\r\n    Because of her I tremble, pulse and vein.\'                      90\r\n  \'Thou must attempt another pilgrimage,\'\r\n    Observing that I wept, he made reply,\r\n    \'If from this waste thyself thou \'dst disengage.\r\n  Because the beast thou art afflicted by\r\n    Will suffer none along her way to pass,\r\n    But, hindering them, harasses till they die.\r\n  So vile a nature and corrupt she has,\r\n    Her raging lust is still insatiate,\r\n    And food but makes it fiercer than it was.\r\n  Many a creature[174] hath she ta\'en for mate,                    100\r\n    And more she\'ll wed until the hound comes forth\r\n    To slay her and afflict with torment great.\r\n  He will not batten upon pelf or earth;\r\n    But he shall feed on valour, love, and lore;\r\n    Feltro and Feltro[175] \'tween shall be his birth.\r\n  He will save humbled Italy, and restore,\r\n    For which of old virgin Camilla[176] died;\r\n    Turnus, Euryalus, Nisus, died of yore.\r\n  Her through all cities chasing far and wide,\r\n    He at the last to Hell will thrust her down,                   110\r\n    Whence envy[177] first unloosed her. I decide\r\n  Therefore and judge that thou hadst best come on\r\n    With me for guide;[178] and hence I\'ll lead thee where\r\n    A place eternal shall to thee be shown.\r\n  There shalt thou hear the howlings of despair\r\n    In which the ancient spirits make lament,\r\n    All of them fain the second death to share.\r\n  Next shalt thou them behold who are content,\r\n    Because they hope some time, though now in fire,\r\n    To join the blessed they will win consent.                     120\r\n  And if to these thou later wouldst aspire,\r\n    A soul[179] shall guide thee, worthier far than I;\r\n    When I depart thee will I leave with her.\r\n  Because the Emperor[180] who reigns on high\r\n    Wills not, since \'gainst His laws I did rebel,[181]\r\n    That to His city I bring any nigh.\r\n  O\'er all the world He rules, there reigns as well;\r\n    There is His city and exalted seat:\r\n    O happy whom He chooses there to dwell!\'\r\n  And I to him: \'Poet, I thee entreat,                             130\r\n    Even by that God who was to thee unknown,\r\n    That I may \'scape this present ill, nor meet\r\n  With worse, conduct me whither thou hast shown,\r\n    That I may see Saint Peter\'s gate,[182] and those\r\n    Whom thou reportest in such misery thrown.\'\r\n  He moved away; behind him held I close.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[160] _Middle_: In his _Convito_ (iv. 23), comparing human life to an\r\narch, Dante says that at the age of thirty-five a man has reached the\r\ntop and begins to go down. As he was born in 1265 that was his own age\r\nin 1300, the year in which the action of the poem is laid.\r\n\r\n[161] _Darksome wood_: A state of spiritual darkness or despair into\r\nwhich he has gradually drifted, not without fault of his own.\r\n\r\n[162] _A hill_: Lower down this hill is termed \'the origin and cause of\r\nall joy.\' It is symbolical of spiritual freedom--of the peace and\r\nsecurity that spring from the practice of virtue. Only, as it seems, by\r\ngaining such a vantage-ground can he escape from the wilderness of\r\ndoubt--the valley of the shadow of death--in which he is lost.\r\n\r\n[163] _That planet_: On the Ptolemaic system, which, as perfected by the\r\nArabian astronomers, and with some Christian additions, was that\r\nfollowed by Dante, the sun is reckoned as one of the seven planets; all\r\nthe others as well as the earth and the fixed stars deriving their light\r\nfrom it. Here the sunlight may signify the Divine help granted to all\r\nmen in their efforts after virtue.\r\n\r\n[164] _The lower foot, etc._: This describes a cautious, slow ascent.\r\n\r\n[165] _A nimble leopard_: The leopard and the lion and wolf that come\r\nwith it are suggested by Jeremiah v. 6: \'A lion out of the forest shall\r\nslay them,\' etc. We have Dante\'s own authority for it, in his letter to\r\nCan Grande, that several meanings are often hidden under the incidents\r\nof the _Comedy_. But whatever else the beasts may signify, their chief\r\nmeaning is that of moral hindrances. It is plain that the lion and wolf\r\nare the sins of others--pride and avarice. If the leopard agrees with\r\nthem in this, it most probably stands for the envy of those among whom\r\nDante lived: at _Inf._ vi. 74 we find envy, pride, and avarice classed\r\ntogether as the sins that have corrupted Florence. But from _Inf._ xvi.\r\n106 it appears that Dante hoped to get the better of the leopard by\r\nmeans of a cord which he wore girt about his loins. The cord is\r\nemblematical of self-control; and hence the leopard seems best to answer\r\nthe idea of sensual pleasure in the sense of a temptation that makes\r\ndifficult the pursuit of virtue. But it will be observed that this\r\nhindrance Dante trusts to overcome.\r\n\r\n[166] _Stars, etc._: The sun being then in Aries, as it was believed to\r\nhave been at the creation.\r\n\r\n[167] _Morn, etc._: It is the morning of Friday the 25th of March in the\r\nyear 1300, and by the use of Florence, which began the year on the\r\nanniversary of the incarnation, it is the first day of the New Year. The\r\nGood Friday of 1300 fell a fortnight later; but the 25th of March was\r\nheld to be the true anniversary of the crucifixion as well as of the\r\nincarnation and of the creation of the world. The date of the action is\r\nfixed by _Inf._ xxi. 112. The day was of good omen for success in the\r\nstruggle with his lower self.\r\n\r\n[168] _A lion_: Pride or arrogance; to be taken in its widest sense of\r\nviolent opposition to all that is good.\r\n\r\n[169] _A she-wolf_: Used elsewhere in the _Comedy_ to represent avarice.\r\nDante may have had specially in his mind the greed and worldly ambition\r\nof the Pope and the Court of Rome, but it is plain from line 110 that\r\nthe wolf stands primarily for a sin, and not for a person or corporate\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n[170] _No man_: Brunetto Latini, the friend and master of Dante, says\r\n\'the soul is the life of man, but without the body is not man.\'\r\n\r\n[171] _Sub Julio_: Julius was not even consul when Virgil was born. But\r\nDante reckoned Julius as the founder of the Empire, and therefore makes\r\nthe time in which he flourished his. Virgil was only twenty-five years\r\nof age when C\xc3\xa6sar was slain; and thus it was under Augustus that his\r\nmaturer life was spent.\r\n\r\n[172] _Author_: Dante defines an author as \'one worthy to be believed\r\nand obeyed\' (_Convito_ iv. 6). For a guide and companion on his great\r\npilgrimage he chooses Virgil, not only because of his fame as a poet,\r\nbut also because he had himself described a descent to the Shades--had\r\nbeen already there. The vulgar conception of Virgil was that of a\r\nvirtuous great magician.\r\n\r\n[173] _The style, etc._: Some at least of Dante\'s minor works had been\r\ngiven to the world before 1300, certainly the _Vita Nuova_ and others of\r\nhis poems. To his study of Virgil he may have felt himself indebted for\r\nthe purity of taste that kept him superior to the frigid and artificial\r\nstyle of his contemporaries, He prided himself on suiting his language\r\nto his theme, as well as on writing straight from the heart.\r\n\r\n[174] _Many a creature, etc._: Great men and states, infected with\r\navarice in its extended sense of encroachment on the rights of others.\r\n\r\n[175] _Feltro and Feltro, etc._: Who the deliverer was that Dante\r\nprophesies the coming of is not known, and perhaps never can be. Against\r\nthe claims of Can Grande of Verona the objection is that, at any date\r\nwhich can reasonably be assigned for the publication of the _Inferno_,\r\nhe had done nothing to justify such bright hopes of his future career.\r\nThere seems proof, too, that till the _Paradiso_ was written Dante\r\nentertained no great respect for the Scala family (_Purg._ xvi. 118,\r\nxviii. 121). Neither is Verona, or the widest territory over which Can\r\nGrande ever ruled, at all described by saying it lay between Feltro and\r\nFeltro.--I have preferred to translate _nazi-one_ as birth rather than\r\nas nation or people. \'The birth of the deliverer will be found to have\r\nbeen between feltro and feltro.\' Feltro, as Dante wrote it, would have\r\nno capital letter; and according to an old gloss the deliverer is to be\r\nof humble birth; _feltro_ being the name of a poor sort of cloth. This\r\ninterpretation I give as a curiosity more than anything else; for the\r\nmost competent critics have decided against it, or ignored it.--Henry of\r\nLuxemburg, chosen Emperor in November 1308, is an old claimant for the\r\npost of the allegorical _veltro_ or greyhound. On him Dante\'s hopes were\r\nlong set as the man who should \'save Italy;\' and it seems not out of\r\nplace to draw attention to what is said of him by John Villani, the\r\ncontemporary and fellow-townsman of Dante: \'He was of a magnanimous\r\nnature, though, as regarded his family, of poor extraction\' (_Cronica_,\r\nix. 1). Whatever may be made of the Feltros, the description in the text\r\nof the deliverer as one superior to all personal ambition certainly\r\nanswers better to Dante\'s ideal of a righteous Emperor than to the\r\ncharacter of a partisan leader like Uguccione della Faggiuola, or an\r\nambitious prince like Can Grande.\r\n\r\n[176] _Camilla, etc._: All persons of the _\xc3\x86neid_.\r\n\r\n[177] _Envy_: That of Satan.\r\n\r\n[178] _Thou hadst best, etc._: As will be seen from the next Canto,\r\nVirgil has been sent to the relief of Dante; but how that is to be\r\nwrought out is left to his own judgment. He might secure a partial\r\ndeliverance for his ward by conducting him up the Delectable Mount--the\r\npeaceful heights familiar to himself, and which are to be won by the\r\npractice of natural piety. He chooses the other course, of guiding Dante\r\nthrough the regions of the future state, where the pilgrim\'s trust in\r\nthe Divine government will be strengthened by what he sees, and his soul\r\nacquire a larger peace.\r\n\r\n[179] _A soul_: Beatrice.\r\n\r\n[180] _The Emperor_: The attribution of this title to God is significant\r\nof Dante\'s lofty conception of the Empire.\r\n\r\n[181] _\'Gainst his laws, etc._: Virgil was a rebel only in the sense of\r\nbeing ignorant of the Christian revelation (_Inf._ iv. 37).\r\n\r\n[182] _Saint Peter\'s gate_: Virgil has not mentioned Saint Peter. Dante\r\nnames him as if to proclaim that it is as a Christian, though under\r\nheathen guidance, that he makes the pilgrimage. Here the gate seems to\r\nbe spoken of as if it formed the entrance to Paradise, as it was\r\npopularly believed to do, and as if it were at that point Virgil would\r\ncease to guide him. But they are to find it nearer at hand, and after it\r\nhas been passed Virgil is to act as guide through Purgatory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO II.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It was the close of day;[183] the twilight brown\r\n    All living things on earth was setting free\r\n    From toil, while I preparing was alone[184]\r\n  To face the battle which awaited me,\r\n    As well of ruth as of the perilous quest,\r\n    Now to be limned by faultless memory.\r\n  Help, lofty genius! Muses,[185] manifest\r\n    Goodwill to me! Recording what befell,\r\n    Do thou, O mind, now show thee at thy best!\r\n  I thus began: \'Poet, and Guide as well,                           10\r\n    Ere trusting me on this adventure wide,\r\n    Judge if my strength of it be capable.\r\n  Thou say\'st that Silvius\' father,[186] ere he died,\r\n    Still mortal to the world immortal went,\r\n    There in the body some time to abide.\r\n  Yet that the Foe of evil was content\r\n    That he should come, seeing what high effect,\r\n    And who and what should from him claim descent,\r\n  No room for doubt can thoughtful man detect:\r\n    For he of noble Rome, and of her sway                           20\r\n    Imperial, in high Heaven grew sire elect.\r\n  And both of these,[187] the very truth to say,\r\n    Were founded for the holy seat, whereon\r\n    The Greater Peter\'s follower sits to-day.\r\n  Upon this journey, praised by thee, were known\r\n    And heard things by him, to the which he owed\r\n    His triumph, whence derives the Papal gown.[188]\r\n  That path the Chosen Vessel[189] later trod\r\n    So of the faith assurance to receive,\r\n    Which is beginning of salvation\'s road.                         30\r\n  But why should I go? Who will sanction give?\r\n    For I am no \xc3\x86neas and no Paul;\r\n    Me worthy of it no one can believe,\r\n  Nor I myself. Hence venturing at thy call,\r\n    I dread the journey may prove rash. But vain\r\n    For me to reason; wise, thou know\'st it all.\'\r\n  Like one no more for what he wished for fain,\r\n    Whose purpose shares mutation with his thought\r\n    Till from the thing begun he turns again;\r\n  On that dim slope so grew I all distraught,                       40\r\n    Because, by brooding on it, the design\r\n    I shrank from, which before I warmly sought.\r\n  \'If well I understand these words of thine,\'\r\n    The shade of him magnanimous made reply,\r\n    \'Thy soul \'neath cowardice hath sunk supine,\r\n  Which a man often is so burdened by,\r\n    It makes him falter from a noble aim,\r\n    As beasts at objects ill-distinguished shy.\r\n  To loose thee from this terror, why I came,\r\n    And what the speech I heard, I will relate,                     50\r\n    When first of all I pitied thee. A dame[190]\r\n  Hailed me where I \'mongst those in dubious state[191]\r\n    Had my abode: so blest was she and fair,\r\n    Her to command me I petitioned straight.\r\n  Her eyes were shining brighter than the star;[192]\r\n    And she began to say in accents sweet\r\n    And tuneable as angel\'s voices are:\r\n  "O Mantuan Shade, in courtesy complete,\r\n    Whose fame survives on earth, nor less shall grow\r\n    Through all the ages, while the world hath seat;                60\r\n  A friend of mine, with fortune for his foe,\r\n    Has met with hindrance on his desert way,\r\n    And, terror-smitten, can no further go,\r\n  But turns; and that he is too far astray,\r\n    And that I rose too late for help, I dread,\r\n    From what in Heaven concerning him they say.\r\n  Go, with thy speech persuasive him bestead,\r\n    And with all needful help his guardian prove,\r\n    That touching him I may be comforted.\r\n  Know, it is Beatrice seeks thee thus to move.                     70\r\n    Thence come I where I to return am fain:\r\n    My coming and my plea are ruled by love.\r\n  When I shall stand before my Lord again,\r\n    Often to Him I will renew thy praise."\r\n    And here she ceased, nor did I dumb remain:\r\n  "O virtuous Lady, thou alone the race\r\n    Of man exaltest \'bove all else that dwell\r\n    Beneath the heaven which wheels in narrowest space.[193]\r\n  To do thy bidding pleases me so well,\r\n    Though \'twere already done \'twere all too slow;                 80\r\n    Thy wish at greater length no need to tell.\r\n  But say, what tempted thee to come thus low,\r\n    Even to this centre, from the region vast,[194]\r\n    Whither again thou art on fire to go?"\r\n  "This much to learn since a desire thou hast,"\r\n    She answered, "briefly thee I\'ll satisfy,\r\n    How, coming here, I through no terrors passed.\r\n  We are, of right, such things alarm\xc3\xa8d by,\r\n    As have the power to hurt us; all beside\r\n    Are harmless, and not fearful. Wherefore I--                    90\r\n  Thus formed by God, His bounty is so wide--\r\n    Am left untouched by all your miseries,\r\n    And through this burning[195] unmolested glide.\r\n  A noble lady[196] is in Heaven, who sighs\r\n    O\'er the obstruction where I\'d have thee go,\r\n    And breaks the rigid edict of the skies.\r\n  Calling on Lucia,[197] thus she made her know\r\n    What she desired: \'Thy vassal[198] now hath need\r\n    Of help from thee; do thou then helpful show.\'\r\n  Lucia, who hates all cruelty, in speed                           100\r\n    Rose, and approaching where I sat at rest,\r\n    To venerable Rachel[199] giving heed,\r\n  Me: \'Beatrice, true praise of God,\' addressed;\r\n    \'Why not help him who had such love for thee,\r\n    And from the vulgar throng to win thee pressed?\r\n  Dost thou not hear him weeping pitiably,\r\n    Nor mark the death now threatening him upon\r\n    A flood[200] than which less awful is the sea?\'\r\n  Never on earth did any ever run,\r\n    Allured by profit or impelled by fear,                         110\r\n    Swifter than I, when speaking she had done,\r\n  From sitting \'mong the blest descended here,\r\n    My trust upon thy comely rhetoric cast,\r\n    Which honours thee and those who lend it ear."\r\n  When of these words she spoken had the last,\r\n    She turned aside bright eyes which tears[201] did fill,\r\n    And I by this was urged to greater haste.\r\n  And so it was I joined thee by her will,\r\n    And from that raging beast delivered thee,\r\n    Which barred the near way up the beauteous hill.               120\r\n  What ails thee then? Why thus a laggard be?\r\n    Why cherish in thy heart a craven fear?\r\n    Where is thy franchise, where thy bravery,\r\n  When three such blessed ladies have a care\r\n    For thee in Heaven\'s court, and these words of mine\r\n    Thee for such wealth of blessedness prepare?\'\r\n  As flowers, by chills nocturnal made to pine\r\n    And shut themselves, when touched by morning bright\r\n    Upon their stems arise, full-blown and fine;\r\n  So of my faltering courage changed the plight,                   130\r\n    And such good cheer ran through my heart, it spurred\r\n    Me to declare, like free-born generous wight:\r\n  \'O pitiful, who for my succour stirred!\r\n    And thou how full of courtesy to run,\r\n    Alert in service, hearkening her true word!\r\n  Thou with thine eloquence my heart hast won\r\n    To keen desire to go, and the intent\r\n    Which first I held I now no longer shun.\r\n  Therefore proceed; my will with thine is blent:\r\n    Thou art my Guide, Lord, Master;[202] thou alone!\'             140\r\n    Thus I; and with him, as he forward went,\r\n  The steep and rugged road I entered on.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[183] _Close of day_: The evening of the Friday. It comes on us with\r\nsomething of a surprise that a whole day has been spent in the attempt\r\nto ascend the hill, and in conference with Virgil.\r\n\r\n[184] _Alone_: Of earthly creatures, though in company with Virgil, a\r\nshade. In these words is to be found the keynote to the Canto. With the\r\nsense of deliverance from immediate danger his enthusiasm has died away.\r\nAfter all, Virgil is only a shade; and his heart misgives him at the\r\nthought of engaging, in the absence of all human companionship, upon a\r\njourney so full of terrors. He is not reassured till Virgil has\r\ndisplayed his commission.\r\n\r\n[185] _Muses_: The invocation comes now, the First Canto being properly\r\nan introduction. Here it may be pointed out, as illustrating the\r\nrefinement of Dante\'s art, that the invocation in the _Purgatorio_ is in\r\na higher strain, and that in the _Paradiso_ in a nobler still.\r\n\r\n[186] _Silvius\' father_: \xc3\x86neas, whose visit to the world of shades is\r\ndescribed in the Sixth _\xc3\x86neid_. He finds there his father Anchises, who\r\nforetells to him the fortunes of his descendants down to the time of\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n[187] _Both of these_: Dante uses language slightly apologetic as he\r\nunfolds to Virgil, the great Imperialist poet, the final cause of Rome\r\nand the Empire. But while he thus exalts the Papal office, making all\r\nRoman history a preparation for its establishment, Dante throughout his\r\nworks is careful to refuse any but a spiritual or religious allegiance\r\nto the Pope, and leaves himself free, as will be frequently seen in the\r\ncourse of the _Comedy_, to blame the Popes as men, while yielding all\r\nhonour to their great office. In this emphatic mention of Rome as the\r\ndivinely-appointed seat of Peter\'s Chair may be implied a censure on the\r\nPope for the transference of the Holy See to Avignon, which was effected\r\nin 1305, between the date assigned to the action of the poem and the\r\nperiod when it was written.\r\n\r\n[188] _Papal gown_: \'The great mantle\' Dante elsewhere terms it; the\r\nemblem of the Papal dignity. It was only in Dante\'s own time that\r\ncoronation began to take the place of investiture with the mantle.\r\n\r\n[189] _Chosen Vessel_: Paul, who like \xc3\x86neas visited the other world,\r\nthough not the same region of it. Throughout the poem instances drawn\r\nfrom profane history, and even poetry and mythology, are given as of\r\nauthority equal to those from Christian sources.\r\n\r\n[190] _A dame_: Beatrice, the heroine of the _Vita Nuova_, at the close\r\nof which Dante promises some day to say of her what was never yet said\r\nof any woman. She died in 1290, aged twenty-four. In the _Comedy_ she\r\nfills different parts: she is the glorified Beatrice Portinari whom\r\nDante first knew as a fair Florentine girl; but she also represents\r\nheavenly truth, or the knowledge of it--the handmaid of eternal life.\r\nTheology is too hard and technical a term to bestow on her. Virgil, for\r\nhis part, represents the knowledge that men may acquire of Divine law by\r\nthe use of their reason, helped by such illumination as was enjoyed by\r\nthe virtuous heathen. In other words, he is the exponent of the Divine\r\nrevelation involved in the Imperial system--for the Empire was never far\r\nfrom Dante\'s thoughts. To him it meant the perfection of just rule, in\r\nwhich due cognisance is taken of every right and of every duty. The\r\nrelation Dante bears to these two is that of erring humanity struggling\r\nto the light. Virgil leads him as far as he can, and then commits him to\r\nthe holier rule of Beatrice. But the poem would lose its charm if the\r\nallegorical meaning of every passage were too closely insisted on. And,\r\nworse than that, it cannot always be found.\r\n\r\n[191] _Dubious state_: The limbo of the virtuous heathen (Canto iv.).\r\n\r\n[192] _The star_: In the _Vita Nuova_ Dante speaks of the star in the\r\nsingular when he means the stars.\r\n\r\n[193] _In narrowest space_: The heaven of the moon, on the Ptolemaic\r\nsystem the lowest of the seven planets. Below it there is only the\r\nheaven of fire, to which all the flames of earth are attracted. The\r\nmeaning is, above all on earth.\r\n\r\n[194] _The region vast_: The empyrean, or tenth and highest heaven of\r\nall. It is an addition by the Christian astronomers to the heavens of\r\nthe Ptolemaic system, and extends above the _primum mobile_, which\r\nimparts to all beneath it a common motion, while leaving its own special\r\nmotion to each. The empyrean is the heaven of Divine rest.\r\n\r\n[195] _Burning_: \'Flame of this burning,\' allegorical, as applied to the\r\nlimbo where Virgil had his abode. He and his companions suffer only from\r\nunfulfilled but lofty desire (_Inf._ iv. 41).\r\n\r\n[196] _A noble lady_: The Virgin Mary, of whom it is said (_Parad._\r\nxxxiii. 16) that her \'benignity not only succours those who ask, but\r\noften anticipates their demand;\' as here. She is the symbol of Divine\r\ngrace in its widest sense. Neither Christ nor Mary is mentioned by name\r\nin the _Inferno_.\r\n\r\n[197] _Lucia_: The martyr saint of Syracuse. Witte (_Dante-Forschungen_,\r\nvol. ii. 30) suggests that Lucia Ubaldini may be meant, a\r\nthirteenth-century Florentine saint, and sister of the Cardinal (_Inf._\r\nx. 120). The day devoted to her memory was the 30th of May. Dante was\r\nborn in May, and if it could be proved that he was born on the 30th of\r\nthe month the suggestion would be plausible. But for the greater Lucy is\r\nto be said that she was especially helpful to those troubled in their\r\neyesight, as Dante was at one time of his life. Here she is the symbol\r\nof illuminating grace.\r\n\r\n[198] _Thy vassal_: Saint Lucy being held in special veneration by\r\nDante; or only that he was one that sought light. The word _fedele_ may\r\nof course, as it usually is, be read in its primary sense of \'faithful\r\none;\' but it is old Italian for vassal; and to take the reference to be\r\nto the duty of the overlord to help his dependant in need seems to give\r\nforce to the appeal.\r\n\r\n[199] _Rachel_: Symbol of the contemplative life.\r\n\r\n[200] _A flood, etc._: \'The sea of troubles\' in which Dante is involved.\r\n\r\n[201] _Tears_: Beatrice weeps for human misery--especially that of\r\nDante--though unaffected by the view of the sufferings of Inferno.\r\n\r\n[202] _My Guide, etc._: After hearing how Virgil was moved to come,\r\nDante accepts him not only for his guide, as he did at the close of the\r\nFirst Canto, but for his lord and master as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO III.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Through me to the city dolorous lies the way,\r\n    Who pass through me shall pains eternal prove,\r\n    Through me are reached the people lost for aye.\r\n  \'Twas Justice did my Glorious Maker move;\r\n    I was created by the Power Divine,[203]\r\n    The Highest Wisdom, and the Primal Love.\r\n  No thing\'s creation earlier was than mine,\r\n    If not eternal;[204] I for aye endure:\r\n    Ye who make entrance, every hope resign!\r\n  These words beheld I writ in hue obscure                          10\r\n    On summit of a gateway; wherefore I:\r\n    \'Hard[205] is their meaning, Master.\' Like one sure\r\n  Beforehand of my thought, he made reply:\r\n    \'Here it behoves to leave all fears behind;\r\n    All cowardice behoveth here to die.\r\n  For now the place I told thee of we find,\r\n    Where thou the miserable folk shouldst see\r\n    Who the true good[206] of reason have resigned.\'\r\n  Then, with a glance of glad serenity,\r\n    He took my hand in his, which made me bold,                     20\r\n    And brought me in where secret things there be.\r\n  There sighs and plaints and wailings uncontrolled\r\n    The dim and starless air resounded through;\r\n    Nor at the first could I from tears withhold.\r\n  The various languages and words of woe,\r\n    The uncouth accents,[207] mixed with angry cries\r\n    And smiting palms and voices loud and low,\r\n  Composed a tumult which doth circling rise\r\n    For ever in that air obscured for aye;\r\n    As when the sand upon the whirlwind flies.                      30\r\n  And, horror-stricken,[208] I began to say:\r\n    \'Master, what sound can this be that I hear,\r\n    And who the folk thus whelmed in misery?\'\r\n  And he replied: \'In this condition drear\r\n    Are held the souls of that inglorious crew\r\n    Who lived unhonoured, but from guilt kept clear.\r\n  Mingled they are with caitiff angels, who,\r\n    Though from avowed rebellion they refrained,\r\n    Disloyal to God, did selfish ends pursue.\r\n  Heaven hurled them forth, lest they her beauty stained;\r\n    Received they are not by the nether hell,                       41\r\n    Else triumph[209] thence were by the guilty gained.\'\r\n  And I: \'What bear they, Master, to compel\r\n    Their lamentations in such grievous tone?\'\r\n    He answered: \'In few words I will thee tell.\r\n  No hope of death is to the wretches known;\r\n    So dim the life and abject where they sigh\r\n    They count all sufferings easier than their own.\r\n  Of them the world endures no memory;\r\n    Mercy and justice them alike disdain.                           50\r\n    Speak we not of them: glance, and pass them by.\'\r\n  I saw a banner[210] when I looked again,\r\n    Which, always whirling round, advanced in haste\r\n    As if despising steadfast to remain.\r\n  And after it so many people chased\r\n    In long procession, I should not have said\r\n    That death[211] had ever wrought such countless waste.\r\n  Some first I recognised, and then the shade\r\n    I saw and knew of him, the search to close,\r\n    Whose dastard soul the great refusal[212] made.                 60\r\n  Straightway I knew and was assured that those\r\n    Were of the tribe of caitiffs,[213] even the race\r\n    Despised of God and hated of His foes.\r\n  The wretches, who when living showed no trace\r\n    Of life, went naked, and were fiercely stung\r\n    By wasps and hornets swarming in that place.\r\n  Blood drawn by these out of their faces sprung\r\n    And, mingled with their tears, was at their feet\r\n    Sucked up by loathsome worms it fell among.\r\n  Casting mine eyes beyond, of these replete,                       70\r\n    People I saw beside an ample stream,\r\n    Whereon I said: \'O Master, I entreat,\r\n  Tell who these are, and by what law they seem\r\n    Impatient till across the river gone;\r\n    As I distinguish by this feeble gleam.\'\r\n  And he: \'These things shall unto thee be known\r\n    What time our footsteps shall at rest be found\r\n    Upon the woful shores of Acheron.\'\r\n  Then with asham\xc3\xa8d eyes cast on the ground,\r\n    Fearing my words were irksome in his ear,                       80\r\n    Until we reached the stream I made no sound.\r\n  And toward us, lo, within a bark drew near\r\n    A veteran[214] who with ancient hair was white,\r\n    Shouting: \'Ye souls depraved, be filled with fear.\r\n  Hope never more of Heaven to win the sight;\r\n    I come to take you to the other strand,\r\n    To frost and fire and everlasting night.\r\n  And thou, O living soul, who there dost stand,\r\n    From \'mong the dead withdraw thee.\' Then, aware\r\n    That not at all I stirred at his command,                       90\r\n  \'By other ways,[215] from other ports thou\'lt fare;\r\n    But they will lead thee to another shore,\r\n    And \'tis a skiff more buoyant must thee bear.\'\r\n  And then my leader: \'Charon, be not sore,\r\n    For thus it has been willed where power ne\'er came\r\n    Short of the will; thou therefore ask no more.\'\r\n  And hereupon his shaggy cheeks grew tame\r\n    Who is the pilot of the livid pool,\r\n    And round about whose eyes glowed wheels of flame.\r\n  But all the shades, naked and spent with dool,                   100\r\n    Stood chattering with their teeth, and changing hue\r\n    Soon as they heard the words unmerciful.\r\n  God they blasphemed, and families whence they grew;\r\n    Mankind, the time, place, seed in which began\r\n    Their lives, and seed whence they were born. Then drew\r\n  They crowding all together, as they ran,\r\n    Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore\r\n    Predestinate for every godless man.\r\n  The demon Charon, with eyes evermore\r\n    Aglow, makes signals, gathering them all;                      110\r\n    And whoso lingers smiteth with his oar.\r\n  And as the faded leaves of autumn fall\r\n    One after the other, till at last the bough\r\n    Sees on the ground spread all its coronal;\r\n  With Adam\'s evil seed so haps it now:\r\n    At signs each falls in turn from off the coast,\r\n    As fowls[216] into the ambush fluttering go.\r\n  The gloomy waters thus by them are crossed,\r\n    And ere upon the further side they land,\r\n    On this, anew, is gathering a host.                            120\r\n  \'Son,\' said the courteous Master,[217] \'understand,\r\n    All such as in the wrath of God expire,\r\n    From every country muster on this strand.\r\n  To cross the river they are all on fire;\r\n    Their wills by Heavenly justice goaded on\r\n    Until their terror merges in desire.\r\n  This way no righteous soul has ever gone;\r\n    Wherefore[218] of thee if Charon should complain,\r\n    Now art thou sure what by his words is shown.\'\r\n  When he had uttered this the dismal plain                        130\r\n    Trembled[219] so violently, my terror past\r\n    Recalling now, I\'m bathed in sweat again.\r\n  Out of the tearful ground there moaned a blast\r\n    Whence lightning flashed forth red and terrible,\r\n    Which vanquished all my senses; and, as cast\r\n  In sudden slumber, to the ground I fell.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[203] _Power Divine, etc._: The Persons of the Trinity, described by\r\ntheir attributes.\r\n\r\n[204] _If not eternal_: Only the angels and the heavenly spheres were\r\ncreated before Inferno. The creation of man came later. But from _Inf._\r\nxxxiv. 124 it appears that Inferno was hollowed out of the earth; and at\r\n_Parad._ vii. 124 the earth is declared to be \'corruptible and enduring\r\nshort while;\' therefore not eternal.\r\n\r\n[205] _Hard, etc._: The injunction to leave all hope behind makes Dante\r\nhesitate to enter. Virgil anticipates the objection before it is fully\r\nexpressed, and reminds him that the passage through Inferno is to be\r\nonly one stage of his journey. Not by this gate will he seek to quit it.\r\n\r\n[206] _True good, etc._: Truth in its highest form--the contemplation of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n[207] _Uncouth accents_: \'Like German,\' says Boccaccio.\r\n\r\n[208] _Horror-stricken_: \'My head enveloped in horror.\' Some texts have\r\n\'error,\' and this yields a better meaning--that Dante is amazed to have\r\ncome full into the crowd of suffering shades before he has even crossed\r\nAcheron. If with the best texts \'horror\' be read, the meaning seems to\r\nbe that he is so overwhelmed by fear as to lose his presence of mind.\r\nThey are not yet in the true Inferno, but only in the vestibule or\r\nforecourt of it--the flat rim which runs round the edge of the pit.\r\n\r\n[209] _Else triumph, etc._: The satisfaction of the rebel angels at\r\nfinding that they endured no worse punishment than that of such as\r\nremained neutral.\r\n\r\n[210] _A banner_: Emblem of the instability of those who would never\r\ntake a side.\r\n\r\n[211] _That death, etc._: The touch is very characteristic of Dante. He\r\nfeigns astonishment at finding that such a proportion of mankind can\r\npreserve so pitiful a middle course between good and evil, and spend\r\nlives that are only \'a kind of--as it were.\'\r\n\r\n[212] _The great refusal_: Dante recognises him, and so he who made the\r\ngreat refusal must have been a contemporary. Almost beyond doubt\r\nCelestine V. is meant, who was in 1294 elected Pope against his will,\r\nand resigned the tiara after wearing it a few months; the only Pope who\r\never resigned it, unless we count Clement I. As he was not canonized\r\ntill 1326, Dante was free to form his own judgment of his conduct. It\r\nhas been objected that Dante would not treat with contumely a man so\r\ndevout as Celestine. But what specially fits him to be the\r\nrepresentative caitiff is just that, being himself virtuous, he\r\npusillanimously threw away the greatest opportunity of doing good. By\r\nhis resignation Boniface VIII. became Pope, to whose meddling in\r\nFlorentine affairs it was that Dante owed his banishment. Indirectly,\r\ntherefore, he owed it to the resignation of Celestine; so that here we\r\nhave the first of many private scores to be paid off in the course of\r\nthe _Comedy_. Celestine\'s resignation is referred to (_Inf._ xxvii.\r\n104).--Esau and the rich young man in the Gospel have both been\r\nsuggested in place of Celestine. To either of them there lies the\r\nobjection that Dante could not have recognised him. And, besides,\r\nDante\'s contemporaries appear at once to have discovered Celestine in\r\nhim who made the great refusal. In Paradise the poet is told by his\r\nancestor Cacciaguida that his rebuke is to be like the wind, which\r\nstrikes most fiercely on the loftiest summits (_Parad._ xvii. 133); and\r\nit agrees well with such a profession, that the first stroke he deals in\r\nthe _Comedy_ is at a Pope.\r\n\r\n[213] _Caitiffs_: To one who had suffered like Dante for the frank part\r\nhe took in affairs, neutrality may well have seemed the unpardonable sin\r\nin politics; and no doubt but that his thoughts were set on the trimmers\r\nin Florence when he wrote, \'Let us not speak of them!\'\r\n\r\n[214] _A veteran_: Charon. In all this description of the passage of the\r\nriver by the shades, Dante borrows freely from Virgil. It has been\r\nalready remarked on _Inf._ ii. 28 that he draws illustrations from Pagan\r\nsources. More than that, as we begin to find, he boldly introduces\r\nlegendary and mythological characters among the persons of his drama.\r\nWith Milton in mind, it surprises, on a first acquaintance with the\r\n_Comedy_, to discover how nearly independent of angels is the economy\r\ninvented by Dante for the other world.\r\n\r\n[215] _Other ways, etc._: The souls bound from earth to Purgatory gather\r\nat the mouth of the Tiber, whence they are wafted on an angel\'s skiff to\r\ntheir destination (_Purg._ ii. 100). It may be here noted that never\r\ndoes Dante hint a fear of one day becoming a denizen of Inferno. It is\r\nonly the pains of Purgatory that oppress his soul by anticipation. So\r\nhere Charon is made to see at a glance that the pilgrim is not of those\r\n\'who make descent to Acheron.\'\r\n\r\n[216] _As fowls, etc._: \'As a bird to its lure\'--generally interpreted\r\nof the falcon when called back. But a witness of the sport of netting\r\nthrushes in Tuscany describes them as \'flying into the vocal ambush in a\r\nhurried, half-reluctant, and very remarkable manner.\'\r\n\r\n[217] _Courteous Master_: Virgil here gives the answer promised at line\r\n76; and Dante by the epithet he uses removes any impression that his\r\nguide had been wanting in courtesy when he bade him wait.\r\n\r\n[218] _Wherefore_: Charon\'s displeasure only proves that he feels he has\r\nno hold on Dante.\r\n\r\n[219] _Trembled, etc._: Symbolical of the increase of woe in Inferno\r\nwhen the doomed souls have landed on the thither side of Acheron. Hell\r\nopens to receive them. Conversely, when any purified soul is released\r\nfrom Purgatory the mountain of purification trembles to its base with\r\njoy (_Purg._ xxi. 58).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Resounding thunder broke the slumber deep\r\n    That drowsed my senses, and myself I shook\r\n    Like one by force awakened out of sleep.\r\n  Then rising up I cast a steady look,\r\n    With eyes refreshed, on all that lay around,\r\n    And cognisance of where I found me took.\r\n  In sooth, me on the valley\'s brink I found\r\n    Of the dolorous abyss, where infinite\r\n    Despairing cries converge with thundering sound.[220]\r\n  Cloudy it was, and deep, and dark as night;                       10\r\n    So dark that, peering eagerly to find\r\n    What its depths held, no object met my sight.\r\n  \'Descend we now into this region blind,\'\r\n    Began the Poet with a face all pale;\r\n    \'I will go first, and do thou come behind.\'\r\n  Marking the wanness on his cheek prevail,\r\n    I asked, \'How can I, seeing thou hast dread,\r\n    My wonted comforter when doubts assail?\'\r\n  \'The anguish of the people,\' then he said,\r\n    \'Who are below, has painted on my face                          20\r\n    Pity,[221] by thee for fear interpreted.\r\n  Come! The long journey bids us move apace.\'\r\n    Then entered he and made me enter too\r\n    The topmost circle girding the abyss.\r\n  Therein, as far as I by listening knew,\r\n    There was no lamentation save of sighs,\r\n    Whence throbbed the air eternal through and through.\r\n  This, sorrow without suffering made arise\r\n    From infants and from women and from men,\r\n    Gathered in great and many companies.                           30\r\n  And the good Master: \'Wouldst thou[222] nothing then\r\n    Of who those spirits are have me relate?\r\n    Yet know, ere passing further, although when\r\n  On earth they sinned not, worth however great\r\n    Availed them not, they being unbaptized--\r\n    Part[223] of the faith thou holdest. If their fate\r\n  Was to be born ere man was Christianised,\r\n    God, as behoved, they never could adore:\r\n    And I myself am with this folk comprised.\r\n  For such defects--our guilt is nothing more--                     40\r\n    We are thus lost, suffering from this alone\r\n    That, hopeless, we our want of bliss deplore.\'\r\n  Greatly I sorrowed when he made this known,\r\n    Because I knew that some who did excel\r\n    In worthiness were to that limbo[224] gone.\r\n  \'Tell me, O Sir,\' I prayed him, \'Master,[225] tell,\'\r\n    --That I of the belief might surety win,\r\n    Victorious every error to dispel--\r\n  \'Did ever any hence to bliss attain\r\n    By merit of another or his own?\'                                50\r\n    And he, to whom my hidden drift[226] was plain:\r\n  \'I to this place but lately[227] had come down,\r\n    When I beheld one hither make descent;\r\n    A Potentate[228] who wore a victor\'s crown.\r\n  The shade of our first sire forth with him went,\r\n    And his son Abel\'s, Noah\'s forth he drew,\r\n    Moses\' who gave the laws, the obedient\r\n  Patriarch Abram\'s, and King David\'s too;\r\n    And, with his sire and children, Israel,\r\n    And Rachel, winning whom such toils he knew;                    60\r\n  And many more, in blessedness to dwell.\r\n    And I would have thee know, earlier than these\r\n    No human soul was ever saved from Hell.\'\r\n  While thus he spake our progress did not cease,\r\n    But we continued through the wood to stray;\r\n    The wood, I mean, with crowded ghosts for trees.\r\n  Ere from the summit far upon our way\r\n    We yet had gone, I saw a flame which glowed,\r\n    Holding a hemisphere[229] of dark at bay.\r\n  \'Twas still a little further on our road,                         70\r\n    Yet not so far but that in part I guessed\r\n    That honourable people there abode.\r\n  \'Of art and science Ornament confessed!\r\n    Who are these honoured in such high degree,\r\n    And in their lot distinguished from the rest?\'\r\n  He said: \'For them their glorious memory,\r\n    Still in thy world the subject of renown,\r\n    Wins grace[230] by Heaven distinguished thus to be.\'\r\n  Meanwhile I heard a voice: \'Be honour shown\r\n    To the illustrious poet,[231] for his shade                     80\r\n    Is now returning which a while was gone.\'\r\n  When the voice paused nor further utterance made,\r\n    Four mighty shades drew near with one accord,\r\n    In aspect neither sorrowful nor glad.\r\n  \'Consider that one, arm\xc3\xa8d with a sword,\'[232]\r\n    Began my worthy Master in my ear,\r\n    \'Before the three advancing like their lord;\r\n  For he is Homer, poet with no peer:\r\n    Horace the satirist is next in line,\r\n    Ovid comes third, and Lucan in the rear.                        90\r\n  And \'tis because their claim agrees with mine\r\n    Upon the name they with one voice did cry,\r\n    They to their honour[233] in my praise combine.\'\r\n  Thus I beheld their goodly company--\r\n    The lords[234] of song in that exalted style\r\n    Which o\'er all others, eagle-like, soars high.\r\n  Having conferred among themselves a while\r\n    They turned toward me and salutation made,\r\n    And, this beholding, did my Master smile.[235]\r\n  And honour higher still to me was paid,                          100\r\n    For of their company they made me one;\r\n    So I the sixth part \'mong such genius played.\r\n  Thus journeyed we to where the brightness shone,\r\n    Holding discourse which now \'tis well to hide,\r\n    As, where I was, to hold it was well done.\r\n  At length we reached a noble castle\'s[236] side\r\n    Which lofty sevenfold walls encompassed round,\r\n    And it was moated by a sparkling tide.\r\n  This we traversed as if it were dry ground;\r\n    I through seven gates did with those sages go;                 110\r\n    Then in a verdant mead people we found\r\n  Whose glances were deliberate and slow.\r\n    Authority was stamped on every face;\r\n    Seldom they spake, in tuneful voices low.\r\n  We drew apart to a high open space\r\n    Upon one side which, luminously serene,\r\n    Did of them all a perfect view embrace.\r\n  Thence, opposite, on the enamel green\r\n    Were shown me mighty spirits; with delight\r\n    I still am stirred them only to have seen.                     120\r\n  With many more, Electra was in sight;\r\n    \'Mong them I Hector and \xc3\x86neas spied,\r\n    C\xc3\xa6sar in arms,[237] his eyes, like falcon\'s, bright.\r\n  And, opposite, Camilla I descried;\r\n    Penthesilea too; the Latian King\r\n    Sat with his child Lavinia by his side.\r\n  Brutus[238] I saw, who Tarquin forth did fling;\r\n    Cornelia, Marcia,[239] Julia, and Lucrece.\r\n    Saladin[240] sat alone. Considering\r\n  What lay beyond with somewhat lifted eyes,                       130\r\n    The Master[241] I beheld of those that know,\r\n    \'Mong such as in philosophy were wise.\r\n  All gazed on him as if toward him to show\r\n    Becoming honour; Plato in advance\r\n    With Socrates: the others stood below.\r\n  Democritus[242] who set the world on chance;\r\n    Thales, Diogenes, Empedocles,\r\n    Zeno, and Anaxagoras met my glance;\r\n  Heraclitus, and Dioscorides,\r\n    Wise judge of nature. Tully, Orpheus, were                     140\r\n    With ethic Seneca and Linus.[243] These,\r\n  And Ptolemy,[244] too, and Euclid, geometer,\r\n    Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicen,[245]\r\n    Averroes,[246] the same who did prepare\r\n  The Comment, saw I; nor can tell again\r\n    The names of all I saw; the subject wide\r\n    So urgent is, time often fails me. Then\r\n  Into two bands the six of us divide;\r\n    Me by another way my Leader wise\r\n    Doth from the calm to air which trembles, guide.               150\r\n  I reach a part[247] which all benighted lies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[220] _Thundering sound_: In a state of unconsciousness, Dante, he knows\r\nnot how, has been conveyed across Acheron, and is awakened by what seems\r\nlike the thunder-peal following the lightning-flash which made him\r\ninsensible. He now stands on the brink of Inferno, where the sounds\r\npeculiar to each region of it converge and are reverberated from its\r\nrim. These sounds are not again to be heard by him except in their\r\nproper localities. No sooner does he actually pass into the First Circle\r\nthan he hears only sighs.--As regards the topography of Inferno, it is\r\nenough, as yet, to note that it consists of a cavity extending from the\r\nsurface to the centre of the earth; narrowing to its base, and with many\r\ncircular ledges or terraces, of great width in the case of the upper\r\nones, running round its wall--that is, round the sides of the pit. Each\r\nterrace or circle is thus less in circumference than the one above it.\r\nFrom one circle to the next there slopes a bank of more or less height\r\nand steepness. Down the bank which falls to the comparatively flat\r\nground of the First Circle they are now about to pass.--To put it\r\notherwise, the Inferno is an inverted hollow cone.\r\n\r\n[221] _Pity_: The pity felt by Virgil has reference only to those in the\r\ncircle they are about to enter, which is his own. See also _Purg._ iii.\r\n43.\r\n\r\n[222] _Wouldst thou, etc._: He will not have Dante form a false opinion\r\nof the character of those condemned to the circle which is his own.\r\n\r\n[223] _Part_: _parte_, altered by some editors into _porta_; but though\r\nbaptism is technically described as the gate of the sacraments, it never\r\nis as the gate of the faith. A tenet of Dante\'s faith was that all the\r\nunbaptized are lost. He had no choice in the matter.\r\n\r\n[224] _Limbo_: Border, or borderland. Dante makes the First Circle\r\nconsist of the two limbos of Thomas Aquinas: that of unbaptized infants,\r\n_limbus puerorum_, and that of the fathers of the old covenant, _limbus\r\nsanctorum patrum_. But the second he finds is now inhabited only by the\r\nvirtuous heathen.\r\n\r\n[225] _Sir_--_Master_: As a delicate means of expressing sympathy, Dante\r\nredoubles his courtesy to Virgil.\r\n\r\n[226] _Hidden drift_: to find out, at first hand as it were, if the\r\narticle in the creed is true which relates to the Descent into Hell;\r\nand, perhaps, to learn if when Christ descended He delivered none of the\r\nvirtuous heathen.\r\n\r\n[227] _Lately_: Virgil died about half a century before the crucifixion.\r\n\r\n[228] _A Potentate_: The name of Christ is not mentioned in the\r\n_Inferno_.\r\n\r\n[229] _A hemisphere, etc._: An elaborate way of saying that part of the\r\nlimbo was clearly lit. The flame is symbolical of the light of genius,\r\nor of virtue; both in Dante\'s eyes being modes of worth.\r\n\r\n[230] _Wins grace, etc._: The thirst for fame was one keenly felt and\r\nopenly confessed by Dante. See, _e.g._ _De Monarchia_, i. 1. In this he\r\nanticipated the humanists of the following century. Here we find that to\r\nbe famous on earth helps the case of disembodied souls.\r\n\r\n[231] _Poet_: Throughout the _Comedy_, with the exception of _Parad._ i.\r\n29, and xxv. 8, the term \'poet\' is confined to those who wrote in Greek\r\nand Latin. In _Purg._ xxi. 85 the name of poet is said to be that \'which\r\nis most enduring and honourable.\'\r\n\r\n[232] _A sword_: Because Homer sings of battles. Dante\'s acquaintance\r\nwith his works can have been but slight, as they were not then\r\ntranslated into Latin, and Dante knew little or no Greek.\r\n\r\n[233] _To their honour_: \'And in that they do well:\' perhaps as showing\r\nthemselves free from jealousy. But the remark of Benvenuto of Imola is:\r\n\'Poets love and honour one another, and are never envious and\r\nquarrelsome like those who cultivate the other arts and sciences.\'--I\r\nquote with misgiving from Tamburini\'s untrustworthy Italian translation.\r\nBenvenuto lectured on the _Comedy_ in Bologna for some years about 1370.\r\nIt is greatly to be wished that his commentary, lively and full of\r\nside-lights as it is, should be printed in full from the original Latin.\r\n\r\n[234] _The lords, etc._: Not the company of him--Homer or Virgil--who is\r\nlord of the great song, and soars above all others; but the company of\r\nthe great masters, whose verse, etc.\r\n\r\n[235] _Did my Master smile_: To see Dante made free of the guild of\r\ngreat poets; or, it may be, to think they are about to discover in him a\r\nfellow poet.\r\n\r\n[236] _A noble castle_: Where the light burns, and in which, as their\r\npeculiar seat, the shades of the heathen distinguished for virtue and\r\ngenius reside. The seven walls are in their number symbolical of the\r\nperfect strength of the castle; or, to take it more pedantically, may\r\nmean the four moral virtues and the three speculative. The gates will\r\nthen stand for the seven liberal arts of grammar, rhetoric, etc. The\r\nmoat may be eloquence, set outside the castle to signify that only as\r\nreflected in the eloquent words of inspired men can the outside world\r\nget to know wisdom. Over the stream Dante passes easily, as being an\r\nadept in learned speech. The castle encloses a spacious mead enamelled\r\nwith eternal green.\r\n\r\n[237] _C\xc3\xa6sar in arms, etc._: Suetonius says of C\xc3\xa6sar that he was of\r\nfair complexion, but had black and piercing eyes. Brunetto Latini,\r\nDante\'s teacher, says in his _Tesoro_ (v. 11), of the hawk here\r\nmentioned--the _grifagno_--that its eyes \'flame like fire.\'\r\n\r\n[238] _Brutus_: Introduced here that he may not be confounded with the\r\nlater Brutus, for whom is reserved the lowest place of all in Inferno.\r\n\r\n[239] _Marcia_: Wife of Cato; mentioned also in _Purg._ i. _Julia_:\r\ndaughter of C\xc3\xa6sar and wife of Pompey.\r\n\r\n[240] _Saladin_: Died 1193. To the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\r\nhe supplied the ideal of a just Mohammedan ruler. Here are no other\r\nsuch. \'He sits apart, because not of gentle birth,\' says Boccaccio;\r\nwhich shows what even a man of genius risks when he becomes a\r\ncommentator.\r\n\r\n[241] _The Master_: Aristotle, often spoken of by Dante as the\r\nPhilosopher, and reverenced by him as the genius to whom the secrets of\r\nnature lay most open.\r\n\r\n[242] _Democritus, etc._: According to whom the world owes its form to a\r\nchance arrangement of atoms.\r\n\r\n[243] _Linus_: Not Livy, into which some have changed it. Linus is\r\nmentioned by Virgil along with Orpheus, _Egl._ iv.\r\n\r\n[244] _Ptolemy_: Greek geographer of the beginning of the second\r\ncentury, and author of the system of the world believed in by Dante, and\r\nfreely used by him throughout the poem.\r\n\r\n[245] _Avicenna_: A physician, born in Bokhara, and died at Ispahan,\r\n1037. His _Medical Canon_ was for centuries used as a text-book in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[246] _Averroes_: A Mohammedan philosopher of Cordova, died 1198. In his\r\ngreat Commentary on Aristotle he gives and explains every sentence of\r\nthat philosopher\'s works. He was himself ignorant of Greek, and made use\r\nof Arabic versions. Out of his Arabic the Commentary was translated into\r\nHebrew, and thence into Latin. The presence of the three Mohammedans in\r\nthis honourable place greatly puzzles the early commentators.\r\n\r\n[247] _A part, etc._: He passes into the darkness of the Limbo out of\r\nthe brightly-lit, fortified enclosure. It is worth remarking, as one\r\nreads, how vividly he describes his first impression of a new scene,\r\nwhile when he comes to leave it a word is all he speaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO V.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From the First Circle thus I downward went\r\n    Into the Second,[248] which girds narrower space,\r\n    But greater woe compelling loud lament.\r\n  Minos[249] waits awful there and snarls, the case\r\n    Examining of all who enter in;\r\n    And, as he girds him, dooms them to their place.\r\n  I say, each ill-starred spirit must begin\r\n    On reaching him its guilt in full to tell;\r\n    And he, omniscient as concerning sin,\r\n  Sees to what circle it belongs in Hell;                           10\r\n    Then round him is his tail as often curled\r\n    As he would have it stages deep to dwell.\r\n  And evermore before him stand a world\r\n    Of shades; and all in turn to judgment come,\r\n    Confess and hear, and then are downward hurled.[250]\r\n  \'O thou who comest to the very home\r\n    Of woe,\' when he beheld me Minos cried,\r\n    Ceasing a while from utterance of doom,\r\n  \'Enter not rashly nor in all confide;\r\n    By ease of entering be not led astray.\'                         20\r\n    \'Why also[251] growling?\' answered him my Guide;\r\n  \'Seek not his course predestinate to stay;\r\n    For thus \'tis willed[252] where nothing ever fails\r\n    Of what is willed. No further speech essay.\'\r\n  And now by me are agonising wails\r\n    Distinguished plain; now am I come outright\r\n    Where grievous lamentation me assails.\r\n  Now had I reached a place devoid of light,\r\n    Raging as in a tempest howls the sea\r\n    When with it winds, blown thwart each other, fight.             30\r\n  The infernal storm is raging ceaselessly,\r\n    Sweeping the shades along with it, and them\r\n    It smites and whirls, nor lets them ever be.\r\n  Arrived at the precipitous extreme,[253]\r\n    In shrieks and lamentations they complain,\r\n    And even the Power Divine itself blaspheme.\r\n  I understood[254] that to this mode of pain\r\n    Are doomed the sinners of the carnal kind,\r\n    Who o\'er their reason let their impulse reign.\r\n  As starlings in the winter-time combined                          40\r\n    Float on the wing in crowded phalanx wide,\r\n    So these bad spirits, driven by that wind,\r\n  Float up and down and veer from side to side;\r\n    Nor for their comfort any hope they spy\r\n    Of rest, or even of suffering mollified.\r\n  And as the cranes[255] in long-drawn company\r\n    Pursue their flight while uttering their song,\r\n    So I beheld approach with wailing cry\r\n  Shades lifted onward by that whirlwind strong.\r\n    \'Master, what folk are these,\'[256] I therefore said,           50\r\n    \'Who by the murky air are whipped along?\'\r\n  \'She, first of them,\' his answer thus was made,\r\n    \'Of whom thou wouldst a wider knowledge win,\r\n    O\'er many tongues and peoples, empire swayed.\r\n  So ruined was she by licentious sin\r\n    That she decreed lust should be uncontrolled,\r\n    To ease the shame that she herself was in.\r\n  She is Semiramis, of whom \'tis told\r\n    She followed Ninus, and his wife had been.\r\n    Hers were the realms now by the Sultan ruled.                   60\r\n  The next[257] is she who, amorous and self-slain,\r\n    Unto Sich\xc3\xa6us\' dust did faithless show:\r\n    Then lustful Cleopatra.\' Next was seen\r\n  Helen, for whom so many years in woe\r\n    Ran out; and I the great Achilles knew,\r\n    Who at the last[258] encountered love for foe.\r\n  Paris I saw and Tristram.[259] In review\r\n    A thousand shades and more, he one by one\r\n    Pointed and named, whom love from life withdrew.\r\n  And after I had heard my Teacher run                              70\r\n    O\'er many a dame of yore and many a knight,\r\n    I, lost in pity, was wellnigh undone.\r\n  Then I: \'O Poet, if I only might\r\n    Speak with the two that as companions hie,\r\n    And on the wind appear to be so light!\'[260]\r\n  And he to me: \'When they shall come more nigh\r\n    Them shalt thou mark, and by the love shalt pray\r\n    Which leads them onward, and they will comply.\'\r\n  Soon as the wind bends them to where we stay\r\n    I lift my voice: \'O wearied souls and worn!                     80\r\n    Come speak with us if none[261] the boon gainsay.\'\r\n  Then even as doves,[262] urged by desire, return\r\n    On outspread wings and firm to their sweet nest\r\n    As through the air by mere volition borne,\r\n  From Dido\'s[263] band those spirits issuing pressed\r\n    Towards where we were, athwart the air malign;\r\n    My passionate prayer such influence possessed.\r\n  \'O living creature,[264] gracious and benign,\r\n    Us visiting in this obscur\xc3\xa8d air,\r\n    Who did the earth with blood incarnadine;                       90\r\n  If in the favour of the King we were\r\n    Who rules the world, we for thy peace[265] would pray,\r\n    Since our misfortunes thy compassion stir.\r\n  Whate\'er now pleases thee to hear or say\r\n    We listen to, or tell, at your demand;[266]\r\n    While yet the wind, as now, doth silent stay.\r\n  My native city[267] lies upon the strand\r\n    Where to the sea descends the river Po\r\n    For peace, with all his tributary band.\r\n  Love, in a generous heart set soon aglow,                        100\r\n    Seized him for the fair form was mine above;\r\n    And still it irks me to have lost it so.[268]\r\n  Love, which absolves[269] no one beloved from love,\r\n    So strong a passion for him in me wrought\r\n    That, as thou seest, I still its mastery prove.\r\n  Love led us where we in one death were caught.\r\n    For him who slew us waits Ca\xc3\xafna[270] now.\'\r\n    Unto our ears these words from them were brought.\r\n  When I had heard these troubled souls, my brow\r\n    I downward bent, and long while musing stayed,                 110\r\n    Until the Poet asked: \'What thinkest thou?\'\r\n  And when I answered him, \'Alas!\' I said,\r\n    \'Sweet thoughts how many, and what strong desire,\r\n    These to their sad catastrophe betrayed!\'\r\n  Then, turned once more to them, I to inquire\r\n    Began: \'Francesca, these thine agonies\r\n    Me with compassion unto tears inspire.\r\n  But tell me, at the season of sweet sighs\r\n    What sign made love, and what the means he chose\r\n    To strip your dubious longings of disguise?\'                   120\r\n  And she to me: \'The bitterest of woes\r\n    Is to remember in the midst of pain\r\n    A happy past; as well thy teacher[271] knows.\r\n  Yet none the less, and since thou art so fain\r\n    The first occasion of our love to hear,\r\n    Like one I speak that cannot tears restrain.\r\n  As we for pastime one day reading were\r\n    How Lancelot[272] by love was fettered fast--\r\n    All by ourselves and without any fear--\r\n  Moved by the tale our eyes we often cast                         130\r\n    On one another, and our colour fled;\r\n    But one word was it, vanquished us at last.\r\n  When how the smile, long wearied for, we read\r\n    Was kissed by him who loved like none before,\r\n    This one, who henceforth never leaves me, laid\r\n  A kiss on my mouth, trembling the while all o\'er.\r\n    The book was Galahad,[273] and he as well\r\n    Who wrote the book. That day we read no more.\'\r\n  And while one shade continued thus to tell,\r\n    The other wept so bitterly, I swooned                          140\r\n    Away for pity, and as dead I fell:\r\n  Yea, as a corpse falls, fell I on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[248] _The Second_: The Second Circle of the Inferno, and the first of\r\npunishment. The lower the circle, the more rigorous the penalty endured\r\nin it. Here is punished carnal sin.\r\n\r\n[249] _Minos_: Son of Jupiter and King of Crete, so severely just as to\r\nbe made after death one of the judges of the under world. He is degraded\r\nby Dante, as many other noble persons of the old mythology are by him,\r\ninto a demon. Unlike the fallen angels of Milton, Dante\'s devils have no\r\ninterest of their own. Their only function is to help in working out\r\nhuman destinies.\r\n\r\n[250] _Downward hurled_: Each falls to his proper place without\r\nlingering by the way. All through Inferno there is an absence of direct\r\nDivine interposition. It is ruled, as it were, by a course of nature.\r\nThe sinners, compelled by a fatal impulse, advance to hear their doom,\r\njust as they fall inevitably one by one into Charon\'s boat. Minos by a\r\nsort of devilish instinct sentences each sinner to his appropriate\r\npunishment. In _Inf._ xxvii. 127 we find the words in which Minos utters\r\nhis judgment. In _Inf._ xxi. 29 a devil bears the sinner to his own\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n[251] _Why also, etc._: Like Charon. If Minos represents conscience, as\r\nsome would have it, Dante is here again assailed by misgivings as to his\r\nenterprise, and is quieted by reason in the person of Virgil.\r\n\r\n[252] _Thus \'tis willed, etc._: These two lines are the same as those to\r\nCharon, _Inf._ iii. 95, 96.\r\n\r\n[253] _Precipitous extreme_: Opinions vary as to what is meant by\r\n_ruina_. As Dante is certainly still on the outer edge of the Second\r\nCircle or terrace, and while standing there hears distinctly the words\r\nthe spirits say when they reach the _ruina_, it most likely denotes the\r\nsteep slope falling from the First to the Second Circle. The spirits,\r\ndriven against the wall which hems them in, burst into sharp\r\nlamentations against their irremediable fate.\r\n\r\n[254] _I understood, etc._: From the nature of the punishment, which,\r\nlike all the others invented by Dante, bears some relation to the sin to\r\nwhich it is assigned. They who on earth failed to exercise\r\nself-restraint are beaten hither and thither by every wind that blows;\r\nand, as once they were blinded by passion, so now they see nothing\r\nplainly in that dim and obscure place. That Dante should assign the\r\nleast grievous punishment of all to this sin throws light upon his views\r\nof life. In his eyes it had more than any other the excuse of natural\r\nbent, and had least of malice. Here, it must be remarked, are no\r\nseducers. For them a lower depth is reserved (_Inf._ xviii. See also\r\n_Purg._ xxvii. 15).\r\n\r\n[255] _The cranes_: \'The cranes are a kind of bird that go in a troop,\r\nas cavaliers go to battle, following one another in single file. And one\r\nof them goes always in front as their gonfalonier, guiding and leading\r\nthem with its voice\' (Brunetto Latini, _Tesoro_, v. 27).\r\n\r\n[256] _What folk are these_: The general crowd of sinners guilty of\r\nunlawful love are described as being close packed like starlings. The\r\nother troop, who go in single file like cranes, are those regarding whom\r\nDante specially inquires; and they prove to be the nobler sort of\r\nsinners--lovers with something tragic or pathetic in their fate.\r\n\r\n[257] _The next_: Dido, perhaps not named by Virgil because to him she\r\nowed her fame. For love of \xc3\x86neas she broke the vow of perpetual chastity\r\nmade on the tomb of her husband.\r\n\r\n[258] _At the last, etc._: Achilles, when about to espouse Polyxena, and\r\nwhen off his guard, was slain.\r\n\r\n[259] _Paris ... and Tristram_: Paris of Troy, and the Tristram of King\r\nArthur\'s Table.\r\n\r\n[260] _So light_: Denoting the violence of the passion to which they had\r\nsuccumbed.\r\n\r\n[261] _If none_: If no Superior Power.\r\n\r\n[262] _Doves_: The motion of the tempest-driven shades is compared to\r\nthe flight of birds--starlings, cranes, and doves. This last simile\r\nprepares us for the tenderness of Francesca\'s tale.\r\n\r\n[263] _Dido_: Has been already indicated, and is now named. This\r\nassociation of the two lovers with Virgil\'s Dido is a further delicate\r\ntouch to engage our sympathy; for her love, though illicit, was the\r\ninfirmity of a noble heart.\r\n\r\n[264] _Living creature_: \'Animal.\' No shade, but an animated body.\r\n\r\n[265] _Thy peace_: Peace from all the doubts that assail him, and which\r\nhave compelled him to the journey: peace, it may be, from temptation to\r\nsin cognate to her own. Even in the gloom of Inferno her great\r\ngoodheartedness is left her--a consolation, if not a grace.\r\n\r\n[266] _Your demand_: By a refinement of courtesy, Francesca, though\r\naddressing only Dante, includes Virgil in her profession of willingness\r\nto tell all they care to hear. But as almost always, he remains silent.\r\nIt is not for his good the journey is being made.\r\n\r\n[267] _Native city_: Ravenna. The speaker is Francesca, daughter of\r\nGuido of Polenta, lord of Ravenna. About the year 1275 she was married\r\nto Gianciotto (Deformed John) Malatesta, son of the lord of Rimini; the\r\nmarriage, like most of that time in the class to which she belonged,\r\nbeing one of political convenience. She allowed her affections to settle\r\non Paolo, her husband\'s handsome brother; and Gianciotto\'s suspicions\r\nhaving been aroused, he surprised the lovers and slew them on the spot.\r\nThis happened at Pesaro. The association of Francesca\'s name with Rimini\r\nis merely accidental. The date of her death is not known. Dante can\r\nnever have set eyes on Francesca; but at the battle of Campaldino in\r\n1289, where he was present, a troop of cavaliers from Pistoia fought on\r\nthe Florentine side under the command of her brother Bernardino; and in\r\nthe following year, Dante being then twenty-five years of age, her\r\nfather, Guido, was Podesta in Florence. The Guido of Polenta, lord of\r\nRavenna, whom Dante had for his last and most generous patron, was\r\ngrandson of that elder Guido, and nephew of Francesca.\r\n\r\n[268] _To have lost it so_: A husband\'s right and duty were too well\r\ndefined in the prevalent social code for her to complain that Gianciotto\r\navenged himself. What she does resent is that she was left no\r\nbreathing-space for repentance and farewells.\r\n\r\n[269] _Which absolves, etc._: Which compels whoever is beloved to love\r\nin return. Here is the key to Dante\'s comparatively lenient estimate of\r\nthe guilt of Francesca\'s sin. See line 39, and _Inf._ xi. 83. The Church\r\nallowed no distinctions with regard to the lost. Dante, for his own\r\npurposes, invents a scale of guilt; and in settling the degrees of it he\r\nis greatly influenced by human feeling--sometimes by private likes and\r\ndislikes. The vestibule of the caitiffs, _e.g._, is his own creation.\r\n\r\n[270] _Ca\xc3\xafna_: The Division of the Ninth and lowest Circle, assigned to\r\nthose treacherous to their kindred (_Inf._ xxxii. 58). Her husband was\r\nstill living in 1300.--May not the words of this line be spoken by\r\nPaolo? It is as a fratricide even more than as the slayer of his wife\r\nthat Gianciotto is to find his place in Ca\xc3\xafna. The words are more in\r\nkeeping with the masculine than the feminine character. They certainly\r\njar somewhat with the gentler censure of line 102. And, immediately\r\nafter, Dante speaks of what the \'souls\' have said.\r\n\r\n[271] _Thy teacher_: Boethius, one of Dante\'s favourite authors\r\n(_Convito_ ii. 13), says in his _De Consol. Phil._, \'The greatest misery\r\nin adverse fortune is once to have been happy.\' But, granting that Dante\r\nfound the idea in Boethius, it is clearly Virgil that Francesca means.\r\nShe sees that Dante\'s guide is a shade, and gathers from his grave\r\npassionless aspect that he is one condemned for ever to look back with\r\nfutile regret upon his happier past.\r\n\r\n[272] _Lancelot_: King Arthur\'s famous knight, who was too bashful to\r\nmake his love for Queen Guinivere known to her. Galahad, holding the\r\nsecret of both, persuaded the Queen to make the first declaration of\r\nlove at a meeting he arranged for between them. Her smile, or laugh, as\r\nshe \'took Lancelot by the chin and kissed him,\' assured her lover of his\r\nconquest. The Arthurian Romances were the favourite reading of the\r\nItalian nobles of Dante\'s time.\r\n\r\n[273] _Galahad_: From the part played by Galahad, or Galeotto, in the\r\ntale of Lancelot, his name grew to be Italian for Pander. The book, says\r\nFrancesca, was that which tells of Galahad; and the author of it proved\r\na very Galahad to us. The early editions of the _Decameron_ bear the\r\nsecond title of \'The Prince Galeotto.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When I regained my senses, which had fled\r\n    At my compassion for the kindred two,\r\n    Which for pure sorrow quite had turned my head,\r\n  New torments and a crowd of sufferers new\r\n    I see around me as I move again,[274]\r\n    Where\'er I turn, where\'er I bend my view.\r\n  In the Third Circle am I of the rain\r\n    Which, heavy, cold, eternal, big with woe,\r\n    Doth always of one kind and force remain.\r\n  Large hail and turbid water, mixed with snow,                     10\r\n    Keep pouring down athwart the murky air;\r\n    And from the ground they fall on, stenches grow.\r\n  The savage Cerberus,[275] a monster drear,\r\n    Howls from his threefold throat with canine cries\r\n    Above the people who are whelm\xc3\xa8d there.\r\n  Oily and black his beard, and red his eyes,\r\n    His belly huge: claws from his fingers sprout.\r\n    The shades he flays, hooks, rends in cruel wise.\r\n  Beat by the rain these, dog-like, yelp and shout,\r\n    And shield themselves in turn with either side;                 20\r\n    And oft[276] the wretched sinners turn about.\r\n  When we by Cerberus, great worm,[277] were spied,\r\n    He oped his mouths and all his fangs he showed,\r\n    While not a limb did motionless abide.\r\n  My Leader having spread his hands abroad,\r\n    Filled both his fists with earth ta\'en from the ground,\r\n    And down the ravening gullets flung the load.\r\n  Then, as sharp set with hunger barks the hound,\r\n    But is appeased when at his meat he gnaws,\r\n    And, worrying it, forgets all else around;                      30\r\n  So with those filthy faces there it was\r\n    Of the fiend Cerberus, who deafs the crowd\r\n    Of souls till they from hearing fain would pause.\r\n  We, travelling o\'er the spirits who lay cowed\r\n    And sorely by the grievous showers harassed,\r\n    Upon their semblances[278] of bodies trod.\r\n  Prone on the ground the whole of them were cast,\r\n    Save one of them who sat upright with speed\r\n    When he beheld that near to him we passed.\r\n  \'O thou who art through this Inferno led,[279]                    40\r\n    Me if thou canst,\' he asked me, \'recognise;\r\n    For ere I was dismantled thou wast made.\'\r\n  And I to him: \'Thy present tortured guise\r\n    Perchance hath blurred my memory of thy face,\r\n    Until it seems I ne\'er on thee set eyes.\r\n  But tell me who thou art, within this place\r\n    So cruel set, exposed to such a pain,\r\n    Than which, if greater, none has more disgrace.\'\r\n  And he: \'Thy city, swelling with the bane\r\n    Of envy till the sack is running o\'er,                          50\r\n    Me in the life serene did once contain.\r\n  As Ciacco[280] me your citizens named of yore;\r\n    And for the damning sin of gluttony\r\n    I, as thou seest, am beaten by this shower.\r\n  No solitary woful soul am I,\r\n    For all of these endure the selfsame doom\r\n    For the same fault.\' Here ended his reply.\r\n  I answered him, \'O Ciacco, with such gloom\r\n    Thy misery weighs me, I to weep am prone;\r\n    But, if thou canst, declare to what shall come                  60\r\n  The citizens[281] of the divided town.\r\n    Holds it one just man? And declare the cause\r\n    Why \'tis of discord such a victim grown.\'\r\n  Then he to me: \'After[282] contentious pause\r\n    Blood will be spilt; the boorish party[283] then\r\n    Will chase the others forth with grievous loss.\r\n  The former it behoves to fall again\r\n    Within three suns, the others to ascend,\r\n    Holpen[284] by him whose wiles ere now are plain.\r\n  Long time, with heads held high, they\'ll make to bend\r\n    The other party under burdens dire,                             71\r\n    Howe\'er themselves in tears and rage they spend.\r\n  There are two just[285] men, at whom none inquire.\r\n    Envy, and pride, and avarice, even these\r\n    Are the three sparks have set all hearts on fire.\'\r\n  With this the tearful sound he made to cease:\r\n    And I to him, \'Yet would I have thee tell--\r\n    And of thy speech do thou the gift increase--\r\n  Tegghiaio[286] and Farinata, honourable,\r\n    James Rusticucci,[287] Mosca, Arrigo,                           80\r\n    With all the rest so studious to excel\r\n  In good; where are they? Help me this to know;\r\n    Great hunger for the news hath seiz\xc3\xa8d me;\r\n    Delights them Heaven, or tortures Hell below?\'\r\n  He said: \'Among the blackest souls they be;\r\n    Them to the bottom weighs another sin.\r\n    Shouldst thou so far descend, thou mayst them see.\r\n  But when[288] the sweet world thou again dost win,\r\n    I pray thee bring me among men to mind;\r\n    No more I tell, nor new reply begin.\'                           90\r\n  Then his straightforward eyes askance declined;\r\n    He looked at me a moment ere his head\r\n    He bowed; then fell flat \'mong the other blind.\r\n  \'Henceforth he waketh not,\' my Leader said,\r\n    \'Till he shall hear the angel\'s trumpet sound,\r\n    Ushering the hostile Judge. By every shade\r\n  Its dismal sepulchre shall then be found,\r\n    Its flesh and ancient form it shall resume,\r\n    And list[289] what echoes in eternal round.\'\r\n  So passed we where the shades and rainy spume                    100\r\n    Made filthy mixture, with steps taken slow;\r\n    Touching a little on the world to come.[290]\r\n  Wherefore I said: \'Master, shall torments grow\r\n    After the awful sentence hath been heard,\r\n    Or lesser prove and not so fiercely glow?\'\r\n  \'Repair unto thy Science,\'[291] was his word;\r\n    \'Which tells, as things approach a perfect state\r\n    To keener joy or suffering they are stirred.\r\n  Therefore although this people cursed by fate\r\n    Ne\'er find perfection in its full extent,                      110\r\n    To it they then shall more approximate\r\n  Than now.\'[292] Our course we round the circle bent,\r\n    Still holding speech, of which I nothing say,\r\n    Until we came where down the pathway went:\r\n  There found we Plutus, the great enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[274] _As I move again_: In his swoon he has been conveyed from the\r\nSecond Circle down to the Third.\r\n\r\n[275] _Cerberus_: In the Greek mythology Cerberus is the watch-dog of\r\nthe under world. By Dante he is converted into a demon, and with his\r\nthree throats, canine voracity, and ugly inflamed bulk, is appropriately\r\nset to guard the entrance to the circle of the gluttonous and\r\nwine-bibbers.\r\n\r\n[276] _And oft, etc._: On entering the circle the shades are seized and\r\ntorn by Cerberus; once over-nice in how they fed, they are now treated\r\nas if they were food for dogs. But their enduring pain is to be\r\nsubjected to every kind of physical discomfort. Their senses of hearing,\r\ntouch, and smell are assailed by the opposite of what they were most\r\nused to enjoy at their luxurious feasts.\r\n\r\n[277] _Great worm_: Though human in a monstrous form, Cerberus is so\r\ncalled as being a disgusting brute.\r\n\r\n[278] _Semblances, etc._: \'Emptiness which seems to be a person.\' To\r\nthis conception of the shades as only seeming to have bodies, Dante has\r\ndifficulty in remaining true. For instance, at line 101 they mix with\r\nthe sleet to make a sludgy mass; and cannot therefore be impalpable.\r\n\r\n[279] Ciacco at once perceives by the weight of Dante\'s tread that he is\r\na living man.\r\n\r\n[280] _Ciacco_: The name or nickname of a Florentine wit, and, in his\r\nday, a great diner-out. Boccaccio, in his commentary, says that, though\r\npoor, Ciacco associated with men of birth and wealth, especially such as\r\nate and drank delicately. In the _Decameron_, ix. 8, he is introduced as\r\nbeing on such terms with the great Corso Donati as to be able to propose\r\nhimself to dinner with him. Clearly he was not a bad fellow, and his\r\npitiful case, perhaps contrasted with the high spirits and jovial\r\nsurroundings in which he was last met by Dante, almost, though not\r\nquite, win a tear from the stern pilgrim.\r\n\r\n[281] _The citizens, etc._: Dante eagerly confers on Florentine politics\r\nwith the first Florentine he encounters in Inferno.\r\n\r\n[282] _After, etc._: In the following nine lines the party history of\r\nFlorence for two years after the period of the poem (March 1300) is\r\nroughly indicated. The city was divided into two factions--the Whites,\r\nled by the great merchant Vieri dei Cerchi, and the Blacks, led by Corso\r\nDonati, a poor and turbulent noble. At the close of 1300 there was a\r\nbloody encounter between the more violent members of the two parties. In\r\nMay 1301 the Blacks were banished. In the autumn of that year they\r\nreturned in triumph to the city in the train of Charles of Valois, and\r\ngot the Whites banished in April 1302, within three years, that is, of\r\nthe poet\'s talk with Ciacco. Dante himself was associated with the\r\nWhites, but not as a violent partisan; for though he was a strong\r\npolitician no party quite answered his views. From the middle of June\r\ntill the middle of August 1300 he was one of the Priors. In the course\r\nof 1301 he is believed to have gone on an embassy to Rome to persuade\r\nthe Pope to abstain from meddling in Florentine affairs. He never\r\nentered Florence again, being condemned virtually to banishment in\r\nJanuary 1302.\r\n\r\n[283] _The boorish party_: _la parte selvaggia_. The Whites; but what is\r\nexactly meant by _selvaggia_ is not clear. Literally it is \'woodland,\'\r\nand some say it refers to the Cerchi having originally come from a\r\nwell-wooded district; which is absurd. Nor, taking the word in its\r\nsecondary meaning of savage, does it apply better to one party than\r\nanother--not so well, perhaps, to the Whites as to the Blacks. Villani\r\nalso terms the Cerchi _salvatichi_ (viii. 39), and in a connection where\r\nit may mean rude, ill-mannered. I take it that Dante here indulges in a\r\ngibe at the party to which he once belonged, but which, ere he began the\r\n_Comedy_, he had quite broken with. In _Parad._ xvii. 62 he terms the\r\nmembers of it \'wicked and stupid.\' The sneer in the text would come well\r\nenough from the witty and soft-living Ciacco.\r\n\r\n[284] _Holpen, etc._: Pope Boniface, already intriguing to gain the\r\npreponderance in Florence, which for a time he enjoyed, with the greedy\r\nand faithless Charles of Valois for his agent.\r\n\r\n[285] _Two just_: Dante and another, unknown. He thus distinctly puts\r\nfrom himself any blame for the evil turn things had taken in Florence.\r\nHow thoroughly he had broken with his party ere he wrote this is proved\r\nby his exclusion of the irresolute but respectable Vieri dei Cerchi from\r\nthe number of the just men. He, in Dante\'s judgment, was only too much\r\nlistened to.--It will be borne in mind that, at the time assigned to the\r\naction of the _Comedy_, Dante was still resident in Florence.\r\n\r\n[286] _Tegghiaio_: See _Inf._ xvi. 42. _Farinata_: _Inf._ x. 32.\r\n\r\n[287] _Rusticucci_: _Inf._ xvi. 44. _Mosca_: _Inf._ xxviii. 106.\r\n_Arrigo_: Cannot be identified. All these distinguished Florentines we\r\nmay assume to have been hospitable patrons of Ciacco\'s.\r\n\r\n[288] _But when, etc._: In the Inferno many such prayers are addressed\r\nto Dante. The shades in Purgatory ask to have their friends on earth\r\nstirred to offer up petitions for their speedy purification and\r\ndeliverance; but the only alleviation possible for the doomed spirits is\r\nto know that they are not yet forgotten up in the \'sweet world.\' A\r\ndouble artistic purpose is served by representing them as feeling thus.\r\nIt relieves the mind to think that in such misery there is any source of\r\ncomfort at all. And by making them be still interested on their own\r\naccount in the thoughts of men, the eager colloquies in which they\r\nengage with Dante on such unequal terms gain in verisimilitude.\r\n\r\n[289] _And list, etc._: The final sentence against them is to echo, in\r\nits results, through all eternity.\r\n\r\n[290] _The world to come_: The life after doomsday.\r\n\r\n[291] _Thy Science_: To Aristotle. In the _Convito_, iv. 16, he quotes\r\n\'the Philosopher\' as teaching that \'everything is then at its full\r\nperfection when it thoroughly fulfils its special functions.\'\r\n\r\n[292] _Than now_: Augustine says that \'after the resurrection of the\r\nflesh the joys of the blessed and the sufferings of the wicked will be\r\nenhanced.\' And, according to Thomas Aquinas, \'the soul, without the\r\nbody, is wanting in the perfection designed for it by Nature.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pape[293] Satan! Pape Satan! Aleppe!\r\n    Plutus[294] began in accents rough and hard:\r\n    And that mild Sage, all-knowing, said to me,\r\n  For my encouragement: \'Pay no regard\r\n    Unto thy fear; whatever power he sways\r\n    Thy passage down this cliff shall not be barred.\'\r\n  Then turning round to that inflam\xc3\xa8d face\r\n    He bade: \'Accursed wolf,[295] at peace remain;\r\n    And, pent within thee, let thy fury blaze.\r\n  Down to the pit we journey not in vain:                           10\r\n    So rule they where by Michael in Heaven\'s height\r\n    On the adulterous pride[296] was vengeance ta\'en.\'\r\n  Then as the bellied sails, by wind swelled tight,\r\n    Suddenly drag whenever snaps the mast;\r\n    Such, falling to the ground, the monster\'s plight.\r\n  To the Fourth Cavern so we downward passed,\r\n    Winning new reaches of the doleful shore\r\n    Where all the vileness of the world is cast.\r\n  Justice of God! which pilest more and more\r\n    Pain as I saw, and travail manifold!                            20\r\n    Why will we sin, to be thus wasted sore?\r\n  As at Charybdis waves are forward rolled\r\n    To break on other billows midway met,\r\n    The people here a counterdance must hold.\r\n  A greater crowd than I had seen as yet,\r\n    With piercing yells advanced on either track,\r\n    Rolling great stones to which their chests were set.\r\n  They crashed together, and then each turned back\r\n    Upon the way he came, while shouts arise,\r\n    \'Why clutch it so?\' and \'Why to hold it slack?\'                 30\r\n  In the dark circle wheeled they on this wise\r\n    From either hand to the opposing part,\r\n    Where evermore they raised insulting cries.\r\n  Thither arrived, each, turning, made fresh start\r\n    Through the half circle[297] a new joust to run;\r\n    And I, stung almost to the very heart,\r\n  Said, \'O my Master, wilt thou make it known\r\n    Who the folk are? Were these all clerks[298] who go\r\n    Before us on the left, with shaven crown?\'\r\n  And he replied: \'All of them squinted so                          40\r\n    In mental vision while in life they were,\r\n    They nothing spent by rule. And this they show,\r\n  And with their yelping voices make appear\r\n    When half-way round the circle they have sped,\r\n    And sins opposing them asunder tear.\r\n  Each wanting thatch of hair upon his head\r\n    Was once a clerk, or pope, or cardinal,\r\n    In whom abound the ripest growths of greed.\'\r\n  And I: \'O Master, surely among all\r\n    Of these I ought[299] some few to recognise,                    50\r\n    Who by such filthy sins were held in thrall.\'\r\n  And he to me: \'Vain thoughts within thee rise;\r\n    Their witless life, which made them vile, now mocks--\r\n    Dimming[300] their faces still--all searching eyes.\r\n  Eternally they meet with hostile shocks;\r\n    These rising from the tomb at last shall stand\r\n    With tight clenched fists, and those with ruined locks.[301]\r\n  Squandering or hoarding, they the happy land[302]\r\n    Have lost, and now are marshalled for this fray;\r\n    Which to describe doth no fine words demand.                    60\r\n  Know hence, my Son, how fleeting is the play\r\n    Of goods at the dispose of Fortune thrown,\r\n    And which mankind to such fierce strife betray.\r\n  Not all the gold which is beneath the moon\r\n    Could purchase peace, nor all that ever was,\r\n    To but one soul of these by toil undone.\'\r\n  \'Master,\' I said, \'tell thou, ere making pause,\r\n    Who Fortune is of whom thou speak\'st askance,\r\n    Who holds all worldly riches in her claws.\'[303]\r\n  \'O foolish creatures, lost in ignorance!\'                         70\r\n    He answer made. \'Now see that the reply\r\n    Thou store, which I concerning her advance.\r\n  He who in knowledge is exalted high,\r\n    Framing[304] all Heavens gave such as should them guide,\r\n    That so each part might shine to all; whereby\r\n  Is equal light diffused on every side:\r\n    And likewise to one guide and governor,\r\n    Of worldly splendours did control confide,\r\n  That she in turns should different peoples dower                  79\r\n    With this vain good; from blood should make it pass\r\n    To blood, in spite of human wit. Hence, power,\r\n  Some races failing,[305] other some amass,\r\n    According to her absolute decree\r\n    Which hidden lurks, like serpent in the grass.\r\n  Vain \'gainst her foresight yours must ever be.\r\n    She makes provision, judges, holds her reign,\r\n    As doth his power supreme each deity.\r\n  Her permutations can no truce sustain;\r\n    Necessity[306] compels her to be swift,\r\n    So swift they follow who their turn must gain.                  90\r\n  And this is she whom they so often[307] lift\r\n    Upon the cross, who ought to yield her praise;\r\n    And blame on her and scorn unjustly shift.\r\n  But she is blest nor hears what any says,\r\n    With other primal creatures turns her sphere,\r\n    Jocund and glad, rejoicing in her ways.\r\n  To greater woe now let us downward steer.\r\n    The stars[308] which rose when I began to guide\r\n    Are falling now, nor may we linger here.\'\r\n  We crossed the circle to the other side,                         100\r\n    Arriving where a boiling fountain fell\r\n    Into a brooklet by its streams supplied.\r\n  In depth of hue the flood did perse[309] excel,\r\n    And we, with this dim stream to lead us on,\r\n    Descended by a pathway terrible.\r\n  A marsh which by the name of Styx is known,\r\n    Fed by this gloomy brook, lies at the base\r\n    Of threatening cliffs hewn out of cold grey stone.\r\n  And I, intent on study of the place,[310]\r\n    Saw people in that ditch, mud-smeared. In it                   110\r\n    All naked stood with anger-clouded face.\r\n  Nor with their fists alone each fiercely hit\r\n    The other, but with feet and chest and head,\r\n    And with their teeth to shreds each other bit.\r\n  \'Son, now behold,\' the worthy Master said,\r\n    \'The souls of those whom anger made a prize;\r\n    And, further, I would have thee certified\r\n  That \'neath the water people utter sighs,\r\n    And make the bubbles to the surface come;\r\n    As thou mayst see by casting round thine eyes.                 120\r\n  Fixed in the mud they say: "We lived in gloom[311]\r\n    In the sweet air made jocund by the day,\r\n    Nursing within us melancholy fume.\r\n  In this black mud we now our gloom display."\r\n    This hymn with gurgling throats they strive to sound,\r\n    Which they in speech unbroken fail to say.\'\r\n  And thus about the loathsome pool we wound\r\n    For a wide arc, between the dry and soft,\r\n    With eyes on those who gulp the filth, turned round.\r\n  At last we reached a tower that soared aloft.                    130\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[293] _Pape, etc._: These words have exercised the ingenuity of many\r\nscholars, who on the whole lean to the opinion that they contain an\r\nappeal to Satan against the invasion of his domain. Virgil seems to have\r\nunderstood them, but the text leaves it doubtful whether Dante himself\r\ndid. Later on, but there with an obvious purpose, we find a line of pure\r\ngibberish (_Inf._ xxxi. 67).\r\n\r\n[294] _Plutus_: The god of riches; degraded here into a demon. He guards\r\nthe Fourth Circle, which is that of the misers and spendthrifts.\r\n\r\n[295] _Wolf_: Frequently used by Dante as symbolical of greed.\r\n\r\n[296] _Pride_: Which in its way was a kind of greed--that of dominion.\r\nSimilarly, the avarice represented by the wolf of Canto i. was seen to\r\nbe the lust of aggrandisement. Virgil here answers Plutus\'s (supposed)\r\nappeal to Satan by referring to the higher Power, under whose protection\r\nhe and his companion come.\r\n\r\n[297] _The half circle_: This Fourth Circle is divided half-way round\r\nbetween the misers and spendthrifts, and the two bands at set periods\r\nclash against one another in their vain effort to pass into the section\r\nbelonging to the opposite party. Their condition is emblematical of\r\ntheir sins while in life. They were one-sided in their use of wealth; so\r\nhere they can never complete the circle. The monotony of their\r\nemployment and of their cries represents their subjection to one idea,\r\nand, as in life, so now, their displeasure is excited by nothing so much\r\nas by coming into contact with the failing opposite to their own. Yet\r\nthey are set in the same circle because the sin of both arose from\r\ninordinate desire of wealth, the miser craving it to hoard, and the\r\nspendthrift to spend. In Purgatory also they are placed together (see\r\n_Purg._ xxii. 40). So, on Dante\'s scheme, liberality is allied to and\r\ndependent on a wise and reasonable frugality.--There is no hint of the\r\nenormous length of the course run by these shades. Far lower down, when\r\nthe circles of the Inferno have greatly narrowed, the circuit is\r\ntwenty-two miles (_Inf._ xxix. 9).\r\n\r\n[298] _Clerks_: Churchmen. The tonsure is the sign that a man is of\r\necclesiastical condition. Many took the tonsure who never became\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n[299] _I ought, etc._: Dante is astonished that he can pick out no\r\ngreedy priest or friar of his acquaintance, when he had known so many.\r\n\r\n[300] _Dimming, etc._: Their original disposition is by this time\r\nsmothered by the predominance of greed. Dante treats these sinners with\r\na special contemptuous bitterness. Scores of times since he became\r\ndependent on the generosity of others he must have watched how at a bare\r\nhint the faces of miser and spendthrift fell, while their eyes travelled\r\nvaguely beyond him, and their voices grew cold.\r\n\r\n[301] _Ruined locks_: \'A spendthrift will spend his very hair,\' says an\r\nItalian proverb.\r\n\r\n[302] _The happy land_: Heaven.\r\n\r\n[303] _Her claws_: Dante speaks of Fortune as if she were a brutal and\r\nsomewhat malicious power. In Virgil\'s answer there is a refutation of\r\nthe opinion of Fortune given by Dante himself, in the _Convito_ (iv.\r\n11). After describing three ways in which the goods of Fortune come to\r\nmen he says: \'In each of these three ways her injustice is manifest.\'\r\nThis part of the _Convito_ Fraticelli seems almost to prove was written\r\nin 1297.\r\n\r\n[304] _Framing, etc._: According to the scholastic theory of the world,\r\neach of the nine heavens was directed in its motion by intelligences,\r\ncalled angels by the vulgar, and by the heathen, gods (_Convito_ ii. 5).\r\nAs these spheres and the influences they exercise on human affairs are\r\nunder the guidance of divinely-appointed ministers, so, Virgil says, is\r\nthe distribution of worldly wealth ruled by Providence through Fortune.\r\n\r\n[305] _Some races failing_: It was long believed, nor is the belief\r\nquite obsolete, that one community can gain only at the expense of\r\nanother. Sir Thomas Browne says: \'All cannot be happy at once; for\r\nbecause the glory of one state depends upon the ruin of another, there\r\nis a revolution and vicissitude of their greatness, and all must obey\r\nthe swing of that wheel, not moved by intelligences, but by the hand of\r\nGod, whereby all states arise to their zeniths and vertical points\r\naccording to their predestinated periods.\'--_Rel. Med._ i. 17.\r\n\r\n[306] _Necessity, etc._: Suggested, perhaps, by Horace\'s _Te semper\r\nanteit s\xc3\xa6va necessitas_ (_Od._ i. 35). The question of how men can be\r\nfree in the face of necessity, here associated with Fortune, more than\r\nonce emerges in the _Comedy_. Dante\'s belief on the subject was\r\nsubstantially that of his favourite author Boethius, who holds that\r\nultimately \'it is Providence that turns the wheel of all things;\' and\r\nwho says, that \'if you spread your sails to the wind you will be\r\ncarried, not where you would, but whither you are driven by the gale: if\r\nyou choose to commit yourself to Fortune, you must endure the manners of\r\nyour mistress.\'\r\n\r\n[307] _Whom they so often, etc._: Treat with contumely.\r\n\r\n[308] _The stars, etc._: It is now past midnight, and towards the\r\nmorning of Saturday, the 26th of March 1300. Only a few hours have been\r\nemployed as yet upon the journey.\r\n\r\n[309] _Perse_: \'Perse is a colour between purple and black, but the\r\nblack predominates\' (_Conv._ iv. 20). The hue of the waters of Styx\r\nagrees with the gloomy temper of the sinners plunged in them.\r\n\r\n[310] _The place_: They are now in the Fifth Circle, where the wrathful\r\nare punished.\r\n\r\n[311] _In gloom_: These submerged spirits are, according to the older\r\ncommentators, the slothful--those guilty of the sin of slackness in the\r\npursuit of good, as, _e.g._ neglect of the means of grace. This is,\r\ntheologically speaking, the sin directly opposed to the active grace of\r\ncharity. By more modern critics it has been ingeniously sought to find\r\nin this circle a place not only for the slothful but for the proud and\r\nenvious as well. To each of these classes of sinners--such of them as\r\nhave repented in this life--a terrace of Purgatory is assigned, and at\r\nfirst sight it does seem natural to expect that the impenitent among\r\nthem should be found in Inferno. But, while in Purgatory souls purge\r\nthemselves of every kind of mortal sin, Inferno, as Dante conceived of\r\nit, contains only such sinners as have been guilty of wicked acts. Drift\r\nand bent of heart and mind are taken no account of. The evil seed must\r\nhave borne a harvest, and the guilt of every victim of Justice must be\r\nplain and open. Now, pride and envy are sins indeed, but sins that a man\r\nmay keep to himself. If they have betrayed the subject of them into the\r\ncommission of crimes, in those crimes they are punished lower down, as\r\nis indicated at xii. 49. And so we find that Lucifer is condemned as a\r\ntraitor, though his treachery sprang from envy: the greater guilt\r\nincludes the less. For sluggishness in the pursuit of good the vestibule\r\nof the caitiffs seems the appropriate place.--There are two kinds of\r\nwrath. One is vehement, and declares itself in violent acts; the other\r\ndoes not blaze out, but is grudging and adverse to all social good--the\r\nwrath that is nursed. One as much as the other affects behaviour. So in\r\nthis circle, as in the preceding, we have represented the two excesses\r\nof one sin.--Dante\'s theory of sins is ably treated of in Witte\'s\r\n_Dante-Forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 121.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I say, continuing,[312] that long before\r\n    To its foundations we approach\xc3\xa8d nigh\r\n    Our eyes went travelling to the top of the tower;\r\n  For, hung out there, two flames[313] we could espy.\r\n    Then at such distance, scarce our eyesight made\r\n    It clearly out, another gave reply.\r\n  And, to the Sea of Knowledge turned, I said:\r\n    \'What meaneth this? and what reply would yield\r\n    That other light, and who have it displayed?\'\r\n  \'Thou shouldst upon the impure watery field,\'                     10\r\n    He said, \'already what approaches know,\r\n    But that the fen-fog holds it still concealed.\'\r\n  Never was arrow yet from sharp-drawn bow\r\n    Urged through the air upon a swifter flight\r\n    Than what I saw a tiny vessel show,\r\n  Across the water shooting into sight;\r\n    A single pilot served it for a crew,\r\n    Who shouted: \'Art thou come, thou guilty sprite?\'[314]\r\n  \'O Phlegyas, Phlegyas,[315] this thy loud halloo!\r\n    For once,\' my Lord said, \'idle is and vain.                     20\r\n    Thou hast us only till the mud we\'re through.\'\r\n  And, as one cheated inly smarts with pain\r\n    When the deceit wrought on him is betrayed,\r\n    His gathering ire could Phlegyas scarce contain.\r\n  Into the bark my Leader stepped, and made\r\n    Me take my place beside him; nor a jot,\r\n    Till I had entered, was it downward weighed.\r\n  Soon as my Guide and I were in the boat,\r\n    To cleave the flood began the ancient prow,\r\n    Deeper[316] than \'tis with others wont to float.                30\r\n  Then, as the stagnant ditch we glided through,\r\n    One smeared with filth in front of me arose\r\n    And said: \'Thus coming ere thy period,[317] who\r\n  Art thou?\' And I: \'As one who forthwith goes\r\n    I come; but thou defiled, how name they thee?\'\r\n    \'I am but one who weeps,\'[318] he said. \'With woes,\'\r\n  I answered him, \'with tears and misery,\r\n    Accurs\xc3\xa8d soul, remain; for thou art known\r\n    Unto me now, all filthy though thou be.\'\r\n  Then both his hands were on the vessel thrown;                    40\r\n    But him my wary Master backward heaved,\r\n    Saying: \'Do thou \'mong the other dogs be gone!\'\r\n  Then to my neck with both his arms he cleaved,\r\n    And kissed my face, and, \'Soul disdainful,\'[319] said,\r\n    \'O blessed she in whom thou wast conceived!\r\n  He in the world great haughtiness displayed.\r\n    No deeds of worth his memory adorn;\r\n    And therefore rages here his sinful shade.\r\n  And many are there by whom crowns are worn\r\n    On earth, shall wallow here like swine in mire,                 50\r\n    Leaving behind them names o\'erwhelmed[320] in scorn.\'\r\n  And I: \'O Master, I have great desire\r\n    To see him well soused in this filthy tide,\r\n    Ere from the lake we finally retire.\'\r\n  And he: \'Or ever shall have been descried\r\n    The shore by thee, thy longing shall be met;\r\n    For such a wish were justly gratified.\'\r\n  A little after in such fierce onset\r\n    The miry people down upon him bore,\r\n    I praise and bless God for it even yet.                         60\r\n  \'Philip Argenti![321] at him!\' was the roar;\r\n    And then that furious spirit Florentine\r\n    Turned with his teeth upon himself and tore.\r\n  Here was he left, nor wins more words of mine.\r\n    Now in my ears a lamentation rung,\r\n    Whence I to search what lies ahead begin.\r\n  And the good Master told me: \'Son, ere long\r\n    We to the city called of Dis[322] draw near,\r\n    Where in great armies cruel burghers[323] throng.\'\r\n  And I: \'Already, Master, I appear                                 70\r\n    Mosques[324] in the valley to distinguish well,\r\n    Vermilion, as if they from furnace were\r\n  Fresh come.\' And he: \'Fires everlasting dwell\r\n    Within them, whence appear they glowing hot,\r\n    As thou discernest in this lower hell.\'\r\n  We to the moat profound at length were brought,\r\n    Which girds that city all disconsolate;\r\n    The walls around it seemed of iron wrought.\r\n  Not without fetching first a compass great,\r\n    We came to where with angry cry at last:                        80\r\n    \'Get out,\' the boatman yelled; \'behold the gate!\'[325]\r\n  More than a thousand, who from Heaven[326] were cast,\r\n    I saw above the gates, who furiously\r\n    Demanded: \'Who, ere death on him has passed,\r\n  Holds through the region of the dead his way?\'\r\n    And my wise Master made to them a sign\r\n    That he had something secretly to say.\r\n  Then ceased they somewhat from their great disdain,\r\n    And said: \'Come thou, but let that one be gone\r\n    Who thus presumptuous enters on this reign.                     90\r\n  Let him retrace his madcap way alone,\r\n    If he but can; thou meanwhile lingering here,\r\n    Through such dark regions who hast led him down.\'\r\n  Judge, reader, if I was not filled with fear,\r\n    Hearing the words of this accurs\xc3\xa8d threat;\r\n    For of return my hopes extinguished were.\r\n  \'Beloved Guide, who more than seven times[327] set\r\n    Me in security, and safely brought\r\n    Through frightful dangers in my progress met,\r\n  Leave me not thus undone;\' I him besought:                       100\r\n    \'If further progress be to us denied,\r\n    Let us retreat together, tarrying not.\'\r\n  The Lord who led me thither then replied:\r\n    \'Fear not: by One so great has been assigned\r\n    Our passage, vainly were all hindrance tried.\r\n  Await me here, and let thy fainting mind\r\n    Be comforted and with good hope be fed,\r\n    Not to be left in this low world behind.\'\r\n  Thus goes he, thus am I abandon\xc3\xa8d\r\n    By my sweet Father. I in doubt remain,                         110\r\n    With Yes and No[328] contending in my head.\r\n  I could not hear what speech he did maintain,\r\n    But no long time conferred he in that place,\r\n    Till, to be first, all inward raced again.\r\n  And then the gates were closed in my Lord\'s face\r\n    By these our enemies; outside stood he;\r\n    Then backward turned to me with lingering pace,\r\n  With downcast eyes, and all the bravery\r\n    Stripped from his brows; and he exclaimed with sighs;\r\n    \'Who dare[329] deny the doleful seats to me!\'                  120\r\n  And then he said: \'Although my wrath arise,\r\n    Fear not, for I to victory will pursue,\r\n    Howe\'er within they plot, the enterprise.\r\n  This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;\r\n    They showed it[330] once at a less secret door\r\n    Which stands unbolted since. Thou didst it view,\r\n  And saw the dark-writ legend which it bore.\r\n    Thence, even now, is one who hastens down\r\n    Through all the circles, guideless, to this shore,\r\n  And he shall win us entrance to the town.\'                       130\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[312] _Continuing_: The account of the Fifth Circle, begun in the\r\npreceding Canto, is continued in this. It is impossible to adopt\r\nBoccaccio\'s story of how the first seven Cantos were found among a heap\r\nof other papers, years after Dante\'s exile began; and that \'continuing\'\r\nmarks the resumption of his work. The word most probably suggested the\r\ninvention of the incident, or at least led to the identification of some\r\nmanuscript that may have been sent to Dante, with the opening pages of\r\nthe _Comedy_. If the tale were true, not only must Ciacco\'s prophecy\r\n(_Inf._ vi.) have been interpolated, but we should be obliged to hold\r\nthat Dante began the poem while he was a prosperous citizen.--Boccaccio\r\nhimself in his Comment on the _Comedy_ points out the difficulty of\r\nreconciling the story with Ciacco\'s prophecy.\r\n\r\n[313] _Two flames_: Denoting the number of passengers who are to be\r\nconveyed across the Stygian pool. It is a signal for the ferryman, and\r\nis answered by a light hung out on the battlements of the city of Dis.\r\n\r\n[314] _Guilty sprite_: Only one is addressed; whether Virgil or Dante is\r\nnot clear.\r\n\r\n[315] _Phlegyas_: Who burnt the temple of Apollo at Delphi in revenge\r\nfor the violation of his daughter by the god.\r\n\r\n[316] _Deeper, etc._: Because used to carry only shades.\r\n\r\n[317] _Ere thy period_: The curiosity of the shade is excited by the\r\nsinking of the boat in the water. He assumes that Dante will one day be\r\ncondemned to Inferno. Neither Francesca nor Ciacco made a like mistake.\r\n\r\n[318] _One who weeps_: He is ashamed to tell his name, and hopes in his\r\nvile disguise to remain unknown by Dante, whose Florentine speech and\r\ndress, and perhaps whose features, he has now recognised.\r\n\r\n[319] _Soul disdainful_: Dante has been found guilty of here glorying in\r\nthe same sin which he so severely reprobates in others. But, without\r\nquestion, of set purpose he here contrasts righteous indignation with\r\nthe ignoble rage punished in this circle. With his quick temper and zeal\r\nso often kindling into flame, he may have felt a special personal need\r\nof emphasising the distinction.\r\n\r\n[320] _Names o\'erwhelmed, etc._: \'Horrible reproaches.\'\r\n\r\n[321] _Philip Argenti_: A Florentine gentleman related to the great\r\nfamily of the Adimari, and a contemporary of Dante\'s. Boccaccio in his\r\ncommentary describes him as a cavalier, very rich, and so ostentatious\r\nthat he once shod his horse with silver, whence his surname. In the\r\n_Decameron_ (ix. 8) he is introduced as violently assaulting--tearing\r\nout his hair and dragging him in the mire--the victim of a practical\r\njoke played by the Ciacco of Canto vi. Some, without reason, suppose\r\nthat Dante shows such severity to him because he was a Black, and so a\r\npolitical opponent of his own.\r\n\r\n[322] _Dis_: A name of Pluto, the god of the infernal regions.\r\n\r\n[323] _Burghers_: The city of Dis composes the Sixth Circle, and, as\r\nimmediately appears, is populated by demons. The sinners punished in it\r\nare not mentioned at all in this Canto, and it seems more reasonable to\r\napply _burghers_ to the demons than to the shades. They are called\r\n_gravi_, generally taken to mean sore burdened, and the description is\r\nthen applicable to the shades; but _grave_ also bears the sense of\r\ncruel, and may describe the fierceness of the devils. Though the city is\r\ninhabited by the subjects of Dis, he is found as Lucifer at the very\r\nbottom of the pit. By some critics the whole of the lower Inferno, all\r\nthat lies beyond this point, is regarded as being the city of Dis. But\r\nit is the Sixth Circle, with its minarets, that is the city; its walls,\r\nhowever, serving as bulwarks for all the lower Inferno. The shape of the\r\ncity is, of course, that of a circular belt. Here it may be noted that\r\nthe Fifth and Sixth Circles are on the same level; the water of Styx,\r\nwhich as a marsh covers the Fifth, is gathered into a moat to surround\r\nthe walls of the Sixth.\r\n\r\n[324] _Mosques_: The feature of an Infidel city that first struck\r\ncrusader and pilgrim.\r\n\r\n[325] _The gate_: They have floated across the stagnant marsh into the\r\ndeeper waters of the moat, and up to the gate where Phlegyas is used to\r\nland his passengers. It may be a question whether his services are\r\nrequired for all who are doomed to the lower Inferno, or only for those\r\nbound to the city.\r\n\r\n[326] _From Heaven_: \'Rained from Heaven.\' Fallen angels.\r\n\r\n[327] _Seven times_: Given as a round number.\r\n\r\n[328] _Yes and No_: He will return--He will not return. The demons have\r\nsaid that Virgil shall remain, and he has promised Dante not to desert\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[329] _Who dare, etc._: Virgil knows the hindrance is only temporary,\r\nbut wonders what superior devilish power can have incited the demons to\r\ndeny him entrance. The incident displays the fallen angels as being\r\nstill rebellious, and is at the same time skilfully conceived to mark a\r\npause before Dante enters on the lower Inferno.\r\n\r\n[330] _They showed it, etc._: At the gate of Inferno, on the occasion of\r\nChrist\'s descent to Limbo. The reference is to the words in the Missal\r\nservice for Easter Eve: \'This is the night in which, having burst the\r\nbonds of death, Christ victoriously ascended from Hell.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The hue which cowardice on my face did paint\r\n    When I beheld my guide return again,\r\n    Put his new colour[331] quicker \'neath restraint.\r\n  Like one who listens did he fixed remain;\r\n    For far to penetrate the air like night,\r\n    And heavy mist, the eye was bent in vain.\r\n  \'Yet surely we must vanquish in the fight;\'\r\n    Thus he, \'unless[332]--but with such proffered aid--\r\n    O how I weary till he come in sight!\'\r\n  Well I remarked how he transition made,                           10\r\n    Covering his opening words with those behind,\r\n    Which contradicted what at first he said.\r\n  Nath\'less his speech with terror charged my mind,\r\n    For, haply, to the word which broken fell\r\n    Worse meaning than he purposed, I assigned.\r\n  Down to this bottom[333] of the dismal shell\r\n    Comes ever any from the First Degree,[334]\r\n    Where all their pain is, stripped of hope to dwell?\r\n  To this my question thus responded he:\r\n    \'Seldom it haps to any to pursue                                20\r\n    The journey now embarked upon by me.\r\n  Yet I ere this descended, it is true,\r\n    Beneath a spell of dire Erichtho\'s[335] laid,\r\n    Who could the corpse with soul inform anew.\r\n  Short while my flesh of me was empty made\r\n    When she required me to o\'erpass that wall,\r\n    From Judas\' circle[336] to abstract a shade.\r\n  That is the deepest, darkest place of all,\r\n    And furthest from the heaven[337] which moves the skies;\r\n    I know the way; fear nought that can befall.                    30\r\n  These fens[338] from which vile exhalations rise\r\n    The doleful city all around invest,\r\n    Which now we reach not save in angry wise.\'\r\n  Of more he spake nought in my mind doth rest,\r\n    For, with mine eyes, my every thought had been\r\n    Fixed on the lofty tower with flaming crest,\r\n  Where, in a moment and upright, were seen\r\n    Three hellish furies, all with blood defaced,\r\n    And woman-like in members and in mien.\r\n  Hydras of brilliant green begirt their waist;                     40\r\n    Snakes and cerastes for their tresses grew,\r\n    And these were round their dreadful temples braced.\r\n  That they the drudges were, full well he knew,\r\n    Of her who is the queen of endless woes,\r\n    And said to me: \'The fierce Erynnyes[339] view!\r\n  Herself upon the left Meg\xc3\xa6ra shows;\r\n    That is Alecto weeping on the right;\r\n    Tisiphone\'s between.\' Here made he close.\r\n  Each with her nails her breast tore, and did smite\r\n    Herself with open palms. They screamed in tone                  50\r\n    So fierce, I to the Poet clove for fright.\r\n  \'Medusa,[340] come, that we may make him stone!\'\r\n    All shouted as they downward gazed; \'Alack!\r\n    Theseus[341] escaped us when he ventured down.\'\r\n  \'Keep thine eyes closed and turn to them thy back,\r\n    For if the Gorgon chance to be displayed\r\n    And thou shouldst look, farewell the upward track!\'\r\n  Thus spake the Master, and himself he swayed\r\n    Me round about; nor put he trust in mine\r\n    But his own hands upon mine eyelids laid.                       60\r\n  O ye with judgment gifted to divine\r\n    Look closely now, and mark what hidden lore\r\n    Lies \'neath the veil of my mysterious line![342]\r\n  Across the turbid waters came a roar\r\n    And crash of sound, which big with fear arose:\r\n    Because of it fell trembling either shore.\r\n  The fashion of it was as when there blows\r\n    A blast by cross heats made to rage amain,\r\n    Which smites the forest and without repose\r\n  The shattered branches sweeps in hurricane;                       70\r\n    In clouds of dust, majestic, onward flies,\r\n    Wild beasts and herdsmen driving o\'er the plain.\r\n  \'Sharpen thy gaze,\' he bade--and freed mine eyes--\r\n    \'Across the foam-flecked immemorial lake,\r\n    Where sourest vapour most unbroken lies.\'\r\n  And as the frogs before the hostile snake\r\n    Together of the water get them clear,\r\n    And on the dry ground, huddling, shelter take;\r\n  More than a thousand ruined souls in fear\r\n    Beheld I flee from one who, dry of feet,                        80\r\n    Was by the Stygian ferry drawing near.\r\n  Waving his left hand he the vapour beat\r\n    Swiftly from \'fore his face, nor seemed he spent\r\n    Save with fatigue at having this to meet.\r\n  Well I opined that he from Heaven[343] was sent,\r\n    And to my Master turned. His gesture taught\r\n    I should be dumb and in obeisance bent.\r\n  Ah me, how with disdain appeared he fraught!\r\n    He reached the gate, which, touching with a rod,[344]\r\n    He oped with ease, for it resisted not.                         90\r\n  \'People despised and banished far from God,\'\r\n    Upon the awful threshold then he spoke,\r\n    \'How holds in you such insolence abode?\r\n  Why kick against that will which never broke\r\n    Short of its end, if ever it begin,\r\n    And often for you fiercer torments woke?\r\n  Butting \'gainst fate, what can ye hope to win?\r\n    Your Cerberus,[345] as is to you well known,\r\n    Still bears for this a well-peeled throat and chin.\'\r\n  Then by the passage foul he back was gone,                       100\r\n    Nor spake to us, but like a man was he\r\n    By other cares[346] absorbed and driven on\r\n  Than that of those who may around him be.\r\n    And we, confiding in the sacred word,\r\n    Moved toward the town in all security.\r\n  We entered without hindrance, and I, spurred\r\n    By my desire the character to know\r\n    And style of place such strong defences gird,\r\n  Entering, begin mine eyes around to throw,\r\n    And see on every hand a vast champaign,                        110\r\n    The teeming seat of torments and of woe.\r\n  And as at Arles[347] where Rhone spreads o\'er the plain,\r\n    Or Pola,[348] hard upon Quarnaro sound\r\n    Which bathes the boundaries Italian,\r\n  The sepulchres uneven make the ground;\r\n    So here on every side, but far more dire\r\n    And grievous was the fashion of them found.\r\n  For scattered \'mid the tombs blazed many a fire,\r\n    Because of which these with such fervour burned\r\n    No arts which work in iron more require.                       120\r\n  All of the lids were lifted. I discerned\r\n    By keen laments which from the tombs arose\r\n    That sad and suffering ones were there inurned.\r\n  I said: \'O Master, tell me who are those\r\n    Buried within the tombs, of whom the sighs\r\n    Come to our ears thus eloquent of woes?\'\r\n  And he to me: \'The lords of heresies[349]\r\n    With followers of all sects, a greater band\r\n    Than thou wouldst think, these sepulchres comprise.\r\n  To lodge them like to like the tombs are planned.                130\r\n    The sepulchres have more or less of heat.\'[350]\r\n    Then passed we, turning to the dexter hand,[351]\r\n  \'Tween torments and the lofty parapet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[331] _New colour_: Both have changed colour, Virgil in anger and Dante\r\nin fear.\r\n\r\n[332] _Unless_: To conceal his misgiving from Dante, Virgil refrains\r\nfrom expressing all his thought. The \'unless\' may refer to what the\r\nlying demons had told him or threatened him with; the \'proffered aid,\'\r\nto that involved in Beatrice\'s request.\r\n\r\n[333] _This bottom_: The lower depths of Inferno. How much still lies\r\nbelow him is unknown to Dante.\r\n\r\n[334] _First Degree_: The limbo where Virgil resides. Dante by an\r\nindirect question, seeks to learn how much experience of Inferno is\r\npossessed by his guide.\r\n\r\n[335] _Erichtho_: A Thessalian sorceress, of whom Lucan (_Pharsalia_\r\nvi.) tells that she evoked a shade to predict to Sextus Pompey the\r\nresult of the war between his father and C\xc3\xa6sar. This happened thirty\r\nyears before the death of Virgil.\r\n\r\n[336] _Judas\' circle_: The Judecca, or very lowest point of the Inferno.\r\nVirgil\'s death preceded that of Judas by fifty years. He gives no hint\r\nof whose the shade was that he went down to fetch; but Lucan\'s tale was\r\nprobably in Dante\'s mind. In the Middle Ages the memory of Virgil was\r\nrevered as that of a great sorcerer, especially in the neighbourhood of\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\n[337] _The heaven, etc._: The _Primum Mobile_; but used here for the\r\nhighest heaven. See _Inf._ ii. 83, _note_.\r\n\r\n[338] _These fens, etc._: Virgil knows the locality. They have no\r\nchoice, but must remain where they are, for the same moat and wall gird\r\nthe city all around.\r\n\r\n[339] _Erynnyes_: The Furies. The Queen of whom they are handmaids is\r\nProserpine, carried off by Dis, or Pluto, to the under world.\r\n\r\n[340] _Medusa_: One of the Gorgons. Whoever looked on the head of Medusa\r\nwas turned into stone.\r\n\r\n[341] _Theseus_: Who descended into the infernal regions to rescue\r\nProserpine, and escaped by the help of Hercules.\r\n\r\n[342] _Mysterious line_: \'Strange verses:\' That the verses are called\r\nstrange, as Boccaccio and others of the older commentators say, because\r\ntreating of such a subject in the vulgar tongue for the first time, and\r\nin rhyme, is difficult to believe. Rather they are strange because of\r\nthe meaning they convey. What that is, Dante warns the reader of\r\nsuperior intellect to pause and consider. It has been noted (_Inf._ ii.\r\n28) how he uses the characters of the old mythology as if believing in\r\ntheir real existence. But this is for his poetical ends. Here he bids us\r\nlook below the surface and seek for the truth hidden under the strange\r\ndisguise.--The opposition to their progress offered by the powers of\r\nHell perplexes even Virgil, while Dante is reduced to a state of\r\nabsolute terror, and is afflicted with still sharper misgivings than he\r\nhad at the first as to the issue of his adventure. By an indirect\r\nquestion he seeks to learn how much Virgil really knows of the economy\r\nof the lower world; but he cannot so much as listen to all of his\r\nMaster\'s reassuring answer, terrified as he is by the sudden appearance\r\nof the Furies upon the tower, which rises out of the city of unbelief.\r\nThese symbolise the trouble of his conscience, and, assailing him with\r\nthreats, shake his already trembling faith in the Divine government.\r\nHow, in the face of such foes, is he to find the peace and liberty of\r\nsoul of which he is in search? That this is the city of unbelief he has\r\nnot yet been told, and without knowing it he is standing under the very\r\nwalls of Doubting Castle. And now, if he chance to let his eyes rest on\r\nthe Gorgon\'s head, his soul will be petrified by despair; like the\r\ndenizens of Hell, he will lose the \'good of the intellect,\' and will\r\npass into a state from which Virgil--or reason--will be powerless to\r\ndeliver him. But Virgil takes him in time, and makes him avert his eyes;\r\nwhich may signify that the only safe course for men is to turn their\r\nbacks on the deep and insoluble problem of how the reality of the Divine\r\ngovernment can be reconciled with the apparent triumph of evil.\r\n\r\n[343] _From Heaven_: The messenger comes from Heaven, and his words are\r\nholy. Against the obvious interpretation, that he is a good angel, there\r\nlies the objection that no other such is met with in Inferno, and also\r\nthat it is spoken of as a new sight for him when Dante first meets with\r\none in Purgatory. But the obstruction now to be overcome is worthy of\r\nangelic interference; and Dante can hardly be said to meet the\r\nmessenger, who does not even glance in his direction. The commentators\r\nhave made this angel mean all kind of outlandish things.\r\n\r\n[344] _A rod_: A piece of the angelic outfit, derived from the\r\n_caduceus_ of Mercury.\r\n\r\n[345] _Cerberus_: Hercules, when Cerberus opposed his entrance to the\r\ninfernal regions, fastened a chain round his neck and dragged him to the\r\ngate. The angel\'s speech answers Dante\'s doubts as to the limits of\r\ndiabolical power.\r\n\r\n[346] _By other cares, etc._: It is not in Inferno that Dante is to hold\r\nconverse with celestial intelligences. The angel, like Beatrice when she\r\nsought Virgil in Limbo, is all on fire to return to his own place.\r\n\r\n[347] _Arles_: The Alyscampo (Elysian Fields) at Arles was an enormous\r\ncemetery, of which ruins still exist. It had a circumference of about\r\nsix miles, and contained numerous sarcophagi dating from Roman times.\r\n\r\n[348] _Pola_: In Istria, near the Gulf of Quarnaro, said to have\r\ncontained many ancient tombs.\r\n\r\n[349] _Lords of heresies_: \'Heresiarchs.\' Dante now learns for the first\r\ntime that Dis is the city of unbelief. Each class of heretics has its\r\nown great sepulchre.\r\n\r\n[350] _More or less of heat_: According to the heinousness of the heresy\r\npunished in each. It was natural to associate heretics and punishment by\r\nfire in days when Dominican monks ruled the roast.\r\n\r\n[351] _Dexter hand_: As they move across the circles, and down from one\r\nto the other, their course is usually to the left hand. Here for some\r\nreason Virgil turns to the right, so as to have the tombs on the left as\r\nhe advances. It may be that a special proof of his knowledge of the\r\nlocality is introduced when most needed--after the repulse by the\r\ndemons--to strengthen Dante\'s confidence in him as a guide; or, as some\r\nsubtly think, they being now about to enter the abode of heresy, the\r\nmovement to the right signifies the importance of the first step in\r\nforming opinion. The only other occasion on which their course is taken\r\nto the right hand is at _Inf._ xvii. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO X.\r\n\r\n\r\n  And now advance we by a narrow track\r\n    Between the torments and the ramparts high,\r\n    My Master first, and I behind his back.\r\n  \'O mighty Virtue,[352] at whose will am I\r\n    Wheeled through these impious circles,\' then I said,\r\n    \'Speak, and in full my longing satisfy.\r\n  The people who within the tombs are laid,\r\n    May they be seen? The coverings are all thrown\r\n    Open, nor is there[353] any guard displayed.\'\r\n  And he to me: \'All shall be fastened down                         10\r\n    When hither from Jehoshaphat[354] they come\r\n    Again in bodies which were once their own.\r\n  All here with Epicurus[355] find their tomb\r\n    Who are his followers, and by whom \'tis held\r\n    That the soul shares the body\'s mortal doom.\r\n  Things here discovered then shall answer yield,\r\n    And quickly, to thy question asked of me;\r\n    As well as[356] to the wish thou hast concealed.\'\r\n  And I: \'Good Leader, if I hide from thee\r\n    My heart, it is that I may little say;                          20\r\n    Nor only now[357] learned I thus dumb to be.\'\r\n  \'O Tuscan, who, still living, mak\'st thy way,\r\n    Modest of speech, through the abode of flame,\r\n    Be pleased[358] a little in this place to stay.\r\n  The accents of thy language thee proclaim\r\n    To be a native of that state renowned\r\n    Which I, perchance, wronged somewhat.\' Sudden came\r\n  These words from out a tomb which there was found\r\n    \'Mongst others; whereon I, compelled by fright,\r\n    A little toward my Leader shifted ground.                       30\r\n  And he: \'Turn round, what ails thee? Lo! upright\r\n    Beginneth Farinata[359] to arise;\r\n    All of him \'bove the girdle comes in sight.\'\r\n  On him already had I fixed mine eyes.\r\n    Towering erect with lifted front and chest,\r\n    He seemed Inferno greatly to despise.\r\n  And toward him I among the tombs was pressed\r\n    By my Guide\'s nimble and courageous hand,\r\n    While he, \'Choose well thy language,\' gave behest.\r\n  Beneath his tomb when I had ta\'en my stand                        40\r\n    Regarding me a moment, \'Of what house\r\n    Art thou?\' as if in scorn, he made demand.\r\n  To show myself obedient, anxious,\r\n    I nothing hid, but told my ancestors;\r\n    And, listening, he gently raised his brows.[360]\r\n  \'Fiercely to me they proved themselves adverse,\r\n    And to my sires and party,\' then he said;\r\n    \'Because of which I did them twice disperse.\'[361]\r\n  I answered him: \'And what although they fled!\r\n    Twice from all quarters they returned with might,               50\r\n    An art not mastered yet by these you[362] led.\'\r\n  Beside him then there issued into sight\r\n    Another shade, uncovered to the chin,\r\n    Propped on his knees, if I surmised aright.\r\n  He peered around as if he fain would win\r\n    Knowledge if any other was with me;\r\n    And then, his hope all spent, did thus begin,\r\n  Weeping: \'By dint of genius if it be\r\n    Thou visit\'st this dark prison, where my son?\r\n    And wherefore not found in thy company?\'                        60\r\n  And I to him: \'I come not here alone:\r\n    He waiting yonder guides me: but disdain\r\n    Of him perchance was by your Guido[363] shown.\'\r\n  The words he used, and manner of his pain,\r\n    Revealed his name to me beyond surmise;\r\n    Hence was I able thus to answer plain.\r\n  Then cried he, and at once upright did rise,\r\n    \'How saidst thou--was? Breathes he not then the air?\r\n    The pleasant light no longer smites his eyes?\'\r\n  When he of hesitation was aware                                   70\r\n    Displayed by me in forming my reply,\r\n    He fell supine, no more to reappear.\r\n  But the magnanimous, at whose bidding I\r\n    Had halted there, the same expression wore,\r\n    Nor budged a jot, nor turned his neck awry.\r\n  \'And if\'--resumed he where he paused before--\r\n    \'They be indeed but slow that art to learn,\r\n    Than this my bed, to hear it pains me more.\r\n  But ere the fiftieth time anew shall burn\r\n    The lady\'s[364] face who reigneth here below,                   80\r\n    Of that sore art thou shalt experience earn.\r\n  And as to the sweet world again thou\'dst go,\r\n    Tell me, why is that people so without\r\n    Ruth for my race,[365] as all their statutes show?\'\r\n  And I to him: \'The slaughter and the rout\r\n    Which made the Arbia[366] to run with red,\r\n    Cause in our fane[367] such prayers to be poured out.\'\r\n  Whereon he heaved a sigh and shook his head:\r\n    \'There I was not alone, nor to embrace\r\n    That cause was I, without good reason, led.                     90\r\n  But there I was alone, when from her place\r\n    All granted Florence should be swept away.\r\n    \'Twas I[368] defended her with open face.\'\r\n  \'So may your seed find peace some better day,\'\r\n    I urged him, \'as this knot you shall untie\r\n    In which my judgment doth entangled stay.\r\n  If I hear rightly, ye, it seems, descry\r\n    Beforehand what time brings, and yet ye seem\r\n    \'Neath other laws[369] as touching what is nigh.\'\r\n  \'Like those who see best what is far from them,                  100\r\n    We see things,\' said he, \'which afar remain;\r\n    Thus much enlightened by the Guide Supreme.\r\n  To know them present or approaching, vain\r\n    Are all our powers; and save what they relate\r\n    Who hither come, of earth no news we gain.\r\n  Hence mayst thou gather in how dead a state\r\n    Shall all our knowledge from that time be thrown\r\n    When of the future shall be closed the gate.\'\r\n  Then, for my fault as if repentant grown,\r\n    I said: \'Report to him who fell supine,                        110\r\n    That still among the living breathes his son.\r\n  And if I, dumb, seemed answer to decline,\r\n    Tell him it was that I upon the knot\r\n    Was pondering then, you helped me to untwine.\'\r\n  Me now my Master called, whence I besought\r\n    With more than former sharpness of the shade,\r\n    To tell me what companions he had got.\r\n  He answered me: \'Some thousand here are laid\r\n    With me; \'mong these the Second Frederick,[370]\r\n    The Cardinal[371] too; of others nought be said.\'              120\r\n  Then was he hid; and towards the Bard antique\r\n    I turned my steps, revolving in my brain\r\n    The ominous words[372] which I had heard him speak.\r\n  He moved, and as we onward went again\r\n    Demanded of me: \'Wherefore thus amazed?\'\r\n    And to his question I made answer plain.\r\n  \'Within thy mind let there be surely placed,\'\r\n    The Sage bade, \'what \'gainst thee thou heardest say.\r\n    Now mark me well\' (his finger here he raised),\r\n  \'When thou shalt stand within her gentle ray                     130\r\n    Whose beauteous eye sees all, she will make known\r\n    The stages[373] of thy journey on life\'s way.\'\r\n  Turning his feet, he to the left moved on;\r\n    Leaving the wall, we to the middle[374] went\r\n    Upon a path that to a vale strikes down,\r\n  Which even to us above its foulness sent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[352] _Virtue_: Virgil is here addressed by a new title, which, with the\r\nwords of deep respect that follow, marks the full restoration of Dante\'s\r\nconfidence in him as his guide.\r\n\r\n[353] _Nor is there, etc._: The gate was found to be strictly guarded,\r\nbut not so are the tombs.\r\n\r\n[354] _Jehoshaphat_: \'I will also gather all nations, and will bring\r\nthem down into the valley of Jehoshaphat\' (Joel iii. 2).\r\n\r\n[355] _Epicurus_: The unbelief in a future life, or rather the\r\nindifference to everything but the calls of ambition and worldly\r\npleasure, common among the nobles of Dante\'s age and that preceding it,\r\nwent by the name of Epicureanism. It is the most radical of heresies,\r\nbecause adverse to the first principles of all religions. Dante, in his\r\ntreatment of heresy, dwells more on what affects conduct as does the\r\ndenial of the Divine government--than on intellectual divergence from\r\northodox belief.\r\n\r\n[356] _As well as, etc._: The question is: \'May they be seen?\' The wish\r\nis a desire to speak with them.\r\n\r\n[357] _Nor only now, etc._: Virgil has on previous occasions imposed\r\nsilence on Dante, as, for instance, at _Inf._ iii. 51.\r\n\r\n[358] _Be pleased, etc._: From one of the sepulchres, to be imagined as\r\na huge sarcophagus, come words similar to the _Siste Viator!_ common on\r\nRoman tombs.\r\n\r\n[359] _Farinata_: Of the great Florentine family of the Uberti, and, in\r\nthe generation before Dante, leader of the Ghibeline or Imperialist\r\nparty in Florence. His memory long survived among his fellow-townsmen as\r\nthat of the typical noble, rough-mannered, unscrupulous, and arrogant;\r\nbut yet, for one good action that he did, he at the same time ranked in\r\nthe popular estimation as a patriot and a hero. Boccaccio, misled\r\nperhaps by the mention of Epicurus, says that he loved rich and delicate\r\nfare. It is because all his thoughts were worldly that he is condemned\r\nto the city of unbelief. Dante has already (_Inf._ vi. 79) inquired\r\nregarding his fate. He died in 1264.\r\n\r\n[360] _His brows_: When Dante tells he is of the Alighieri, a Guelf\r\nfamily, Farinata shows some slight displeasure. Or, as a modern\r\nFlorentine critic interprets the gesture, he has to think a moment\r\nbefore he can remember on which side the Alighieri ranged\r\nthemselves--they being of the small gentry, while he was a great noble,\r\nBut this gloss requires Dante to have been more free from pride of\r\nfamily than he really was.\r\n\r\n[361] _Twice disperse_: The Alighieri shared in the exile of the Guelfs\r\nin 1248 and 1260.\r\n\r\n[362] _You_: See also line 95. Dante never uses the plural form to a\r\nsingle person except when desirous of showing social as distinguished\r\nfrom, or over and above, moral respect.\r\n\r\n[363] _Guido_: Farinata\'s companion in the tomb is Cavalcante\r\nCavalcanti, who, although a Guelf, was tainted with the more specially\r\nGhibeline error of Epicureanism. When in order to allay party rancour\r\nsome of the Guelf and Ghibeline families were forced to intermarry, his\r\nson Guido took a daughter of Farinata\'s to wife. This was in 1267, so\r\nthat Guido was much older than Dante. Yet they were very intimate, and,\r\nintellectually, had much in common. With him Dante exchanged poems of\r\noccasion, and he terms him more than once in the _Vita Nuova_ his chief\r\nfriend. The disdain of Virgil need not mean more than is on the surface.\r\nGuido died in 1301. He is the hero of the _Decameron_, vi. 9.\r\n\r\n[364] _The Lady_: Proserpine; _i.e._ the moon. Ere fifty months from\r\nMarch 1300 were past, Dante was to see the failure of more than one\r\nattempt made by the exiles, of whom he was one, to gain entrance to\r\nFlorence. The great attempt was in the beginning of 1304.\r\n\r\n[365] _Ruth for my race_: When the Ghibeline power was finally broken in\r\nFlorence the Uberti were always specially excluded from any amnesty.\r\nThere is mention of the political execution of at least one descendant\r\nof Farinata\'s. His son when being led to the scaffold said, \'So we pay\r\nour fathers\' debts!\'--It has been so long common to describe Dante as a\r\nGhibeline, though no careful writer does it now, that it may be worth\r\nwhile here to remark that Ghibelinism, as Farinata understood it, was\r\npractically extinct in Florence ere Dante entered political life.\r\n\r\n[366] _The Arbia_: At Montaperti, on the Arbia, a few miles from Siena,\r\nwas fought in 1260 a great battle between the Guelf Florence and her\r\nallies on the one hand, and on the other the Ghibelines of Florence,\r\nthen in exile, under Farinata; the Sienese and Tuscan Ghibelines in\r\ngeneral; and some hundreds of men-at-arms lent by Manfred.\r\nNotwithstanding the gallant behaviour of the Florentine burghers, the\r\nGuelf defeat was overwhelming, and not only did the Arbia run red with\r\nFlorentine blood--in a figure--but the battle of Montaperti ruined for a\r\ntime the cause of popular liberty and general improvement in Florence.\r\n\r\n[367] _Our fane_: The Parliament of the people used to meet in Santa\r\nReparata, the cathedral; and it is possible that the maintenance of the\r\nUberti disabilities was there more than once confirmed by the general\r\nbody of the citizens. The use of the word is in any case accounted for\r\nby the frequency of political conferences in churches. And the temple\r\nhaving been introduced, edicts are converted into \'prayers.\'\r\n\r\n[368] _\'Twas I, etc._: Some little time after the victory of Montaperti\r\nthere was a great Ghibeline gathering from various cities at Empoli,\r\nwhen it was proposed, with general approval, to level Florence with the\r\nground in revenge for the obstinate Guelfism of the population. Farinata\r\nroughly declared that as long as he lived and had a sword he would\r\ndefend his native place, and in the face of this protest the resolution\r\nwas departed from. It is difficult to understand how of all the\r\nFlorentine nobles, whose wealth consisted largely in house property,\r\nFarinata should have stood alone in protesting against the ruin of the\r\ncity. But so it seems to have been; and in this great passage Farinata\r\nis repaid for his service, in despite of Inferno.\r\n\r\n[369] _Other laws_: Ciacco, in Canto vi., prophesied what was to happen\r\nin Florence, and Farinata has just told him that four years later than\r\nnow he will have failed in an attempt to return from exile: yet Farinata\r\ndoes not know if his family is still being persecuted, and Cavalcanti\r\nfears that his son Guido is already numbered with the dead. Farinata\r\nreplies that like the longsighted the shades can only see what is some\r\ndistance off, and are ignorant of what is going on, or about to happen;\r\nwhich seems to imply that they forget what they once foresaw. Guido was\r\nto die within a few months, and the event was too close at hand to come\r\nwithin the range of his father\'s vision.\r\n\r\n[370] _The Second Frederick_: The Emperor of that name who reigned from\r\n1220 to 1250, and waged a life-long war with the Popes for supremacy in\r\nItaly. It is not however for his enmity with Rome that he is placed in\r\nthe Sixth Circle, but for his Epicureanism--as Dante understood it. From\r\nhis Sicilian court a spirit of free inquiry spread through the\r\nPeninsula. With men of the stamp of Farinata it would be converted into\r\na crude materialism.\r\n\r\n[371] _The Cardinal_: Ottaviano, of the powerful Tuscan family of the\r\nUbaldini, a man of great political activity, and known in Tuscany as\r\n\'The Cardinal.\' His sympathies were not with the Roman Court. The news\r\nof Montaperti filled him with delight, and later, when the Tuscan\r\nGhibelines refused him money he had asked for, he burst out with \'And\r\nyet I have lost my soul for the Ghibelines--if I have a soul.\' He died\r\nnot earlier than 1273. After these illustrious names Farinata scorns to\r\nmention meaner ones.\r\n\r\n[372] _Ominous words_: Those in which Farinata foretold Dante\'s exile.\r\n\r\n[373] _The stages, etc._: It is Cacciaguida, his ancestor, who in\r\nParadise instructs Dante in what his future life is to be--one of\r\npoverty and exile (_Parad._ xvii.). This is, however, done at the\r\nrequest of Beatrice.\r\n\r\n[374] _To the middle_: Turning to the left they cut across the circle\r\ntill they reach the inner boundary of the city of tombs. Here there is\r\nno wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We at the margin of a lofty steep\r\n    Made of great shattered stones in circle bent,\r\n    Arrived where worser torments crowd the deep.\r\n  So horrible a stench and violent\r\n    Was upward wafted from the vast abyss,[375]\r\n    Behind the cover we for shelter went\r\n  Of a great tomb where I saw written this:\r\n    \'Pope Anastasius[376] is within me thrust,\r\n    Whom the straight way Photinus made to miss.\'\r\n  \'Now on our course a while we linger must,\'                       10\r\n    The Master said, \'be but our sense resigned\r\n    A little to it, and the filthy gust\r\n  We shall not heed.\' Then I: \'Do thou but find\r\n    Some compensation lest our time should run\r\n    Wasted.\' And he: \'Behold, \'twas in my mind.\r\n  Girt by the rocks before us, O my son,\r\n    Lie three small circles,\'[377] he began to tell,\r\n    \'Graded like those with which thou now hast done,\r\n  All of them filled with spirits miserable.\r\n    That sight[378] of them may thee henceforth suffice.            20\r\n    Hear how and wherefore in these groups they dwell.\r\n  Whate\'er in Heaven\'s abhorred as wickedness\r\n    Has injury[379] for its end; in others\' bane\r\n    By fraud resulting or in violent wise.\r\n  Since fraud to man alone[380] doth appertain,\r\n    God hates it most; and hence the fraudulent band,\r\n    Set lowest down, endure a fiercer pain.\r\n  Of the violent is the circle next at hand\r\n    To us; and since three ways is violence shown,\r\n    \'Tis in three several circuits built and planned.               30\r\n  To God, ourselves, or neighbours may be done\r\n    Violence, or on the things by them possessed;\r\n    As reasoning clear shall unto thee make known.\r\n  Our neighbour may by violence be distressed\r\n    With grievous wounds, or slain; his goods and lands\r\n    By havoc, fire, and plunder be oppressed.\r\n  Hence those who wound and slay with violent hands,\r\n    Robbers, and spoilers, in the nearest round\r\n    Are all tormented in their various bands.\r\n  Violent against himself may man be found,                         40\r\n    And \'gainst his goods; therefore without avail\r\n    They in the next are in repentance drowned\r\n  Who on themselves loss of your world entail,\r\n    Who gamble[381] and their substance madly spend,\r\n    And who when called to joy lament and wail.\r\n  And even to God may violence extend\r\n    By heart denial and by blasphemy,\r\n    Scorning what nature doth in bounty lend.\r\n  Sodom and Cahors[382] hence are doomed to lie\r\n    Within the narrowest circlet surely sealed;                     50\r\n    And such as God within their hearts defy.\r\n  Fraud,[383] \'gainst whose bite no conscience findeth shield,\r\n    A man may use with one who in him lays\r\n    Trust, or with those who no such credence yield.\r\n  Beneath this latter kind of it decays\r\n    The bond of love which out of nature grew;\r\n    Hence, in the second circle[384] herd the race\r\n  To feigning given and flattery, who pursue\r\n    Magic, false coining, theft, and simony,\r\n    Pimps, barrators, and suchlike residue.                         60\r\n  The other form of fraud makes nullity\r\n    Of natural bonds; and, what is more than those,\r\n    The special trust whence men on men rely.\r\n  Hence in the place whereon all things repose,\r\n    The narrowest circle and the seat of Dis,[385]\r\n    Each traitor\'s gulfed in everlasting woes.\'\r\n  \'Thy explanation, Master, as to this\r\n    Is clear,\' I said, \'and thou hast plainly told\r\n    Who are the people stowed in the abyss.\r\n  But tell why those the muddy marshes hold,                        70\r\n    The tempest-driven, those beaten by the rain,\r\n    And such as, meeting, virulently scold,\r\n  Are not within the crimson city ta\'en\r\n    For punishment, if hateful unto God;\r\n    And, if not hateful, wherefore doomed to pain?\'\r\n  And he to me: \'Why wander thus abroad,\r\n    More than is wont, thy wits? or how engrossed\r\n    Is now thy mind, and on what things bestowed?\r\n  Hast thou the memory of the passage lost\r\n    In which thy Ethics[386] for their subject treat                80\r\n    Of the three moods by Heaven abhorred the most--\r\n  Malice and bestiality complete;\r\n    And how, compared with these, incontinence\r\n    Offends God less, and lesser blame doth meet?\r\n  If of this doctrine thou extract the sense,\r\n    And call to memory what people are\r\n    Above, outside, in endless penitence,\r\n  Why from these guilty they are sundered far\r\n    Thou shalt discern, and why on them alight\r\n    The strokes of justice in less angry war.\'                      90\r\n  \'O Sun that clearest every troubled sight,\r\n    So charmed am I by thy resolving speech,\r\n    Doubt yields me joy no less than knowing right.\r\n  Therefore, I pray, a little backward reach,\'\r\n    I asked, \'to where thou say\'st that usury\r\n    Sins \'gainst God\'s bounty; and this mystery teach.\'\r\n  He said: \'Who gives ear to Philosophy\r\n    Is taught by her, nor in one place alone,\r\n    What nature in her course is governed by,\r\n  Even Mind Divine, and art which thence hath grown;               100\r\n    And if thy Physics[387] thou wilt search within,\r\n    Thou\'lt find ere many leaves are open thrown,\r\n  This art by yours, far as your art can win,\r\n    Is followed close--the teacher by the taught;\r\n    As grandchild then to God your art is kin.\r\n  And from these two--do thou recall to thought\r\n    How Genesis[388] begins--should come supplies\r\n    Of food for man, and other wealth be sought.\r\n  And, since another plan the usurer plies,\r\n    Nature and nature\'s child have his disdain;[389]               110\r\n    Because on other ground his hope relies.\r\n  But come,[390] for to advance I now am fain:\r\n    The Fishes[391] over the horizon line\r\n    Quiver; o\'er Caurus now stands all the Wain;\r\n  And further yonder does the cliff decline.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[375] _Vast abyss_: They are now at the inner side of the Sixth Circle,\r\nand upon the verge of the rocky steep which slopes down from it into the\r\nSeventh. All the lower Hell lies beneath them, and it is from that\r\nrather than from the next circle in particular that the stench arises,\r\nsymbolical of the foulness of the sins which are punished there. The\r\nnoisome smells which make part of the horror of Inferno are after this\r\nsometimes mentioned, but never dwelt upon (_Inf._ xviii. 106, and xxix.\r\n50).\r\n\r\n[376] _Pope Anastasius_: The second of the name, elected Pope in 496.\r\nPhotinus, bishop of Sirenium, was infected with the Sabellian heresy,\r\nbut he was deposed more than a century before the time of Anastasius.\r\nDante follows some obscure legend in charging Anastasius with heresy.\r\nThe important point is that the one heretic, in the sense usually\r\nattached to the term, named as being in the city of unbelief, is a Pope.\r\n\r\n[377] _Three small circles_: The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth; small in\r\ncircumference compared with those above. The pilgrims are now deep in\r\nthe hollow cone.\r\n\r\n[378] _That sight, etc._: After hearing the following explanation Dante\r\nno longer asks to what classes the sinners met with belong, but only as\r\nto the guilt of individual shades.\r\n\r\n[379] _Injury_: They have left above them the circles of those whose sin\r\nconsists in the exaggeration or misdirection of a wholesome natural\r\ninstinct. Below them lie the circles filled with such as have been\r\nguilty of malicious wickedness. This manifests itself in two ways: by\r\nviolence or by fraud. After first mentioning in a general way that the\r\nfraudulent are set lowest in Inferno, Virgil proceeds to define\r\nviolence, and to tell how the violent occupy the circle immediately\r\nbeneath them--the Seventh. For division of the maliciously wicked into\r\ntwo classes Dante is supposed to be indebted to Cicero: \'Injury may be\r\nwrought by force or by fraud.... Both are unnatural for man, but fraud\r\nis the more hateful.\'--_De Officiis_, i. 13. It is remarkable that\r\nVirgil says nothing of those in the Sixth Circle in this account of the\r\nclasses of sinners.\r\n\r\n[380] _To man alone, etc._: Fraud involves the corrupt use of the powers\r\nthat distinguish us from the brutes.\r\n\r\n[381] _Who gamble, etc._: A different sin from the lavish spending\r\npunished in the Fourth Circle (_Inf._ vii.). The distinction is that\r\nbetween thriftlessness and the prodigality which, stripping a man of the\r\nmeans of living, disgusts him with life, as described in the following\r\nline. It is from among prodigals that the ranks of suicides are greatly\r\nfilled, and here they are appropriately placed together. It may seem\r\nstrange that in his classification of guilt Dante should rank violence\r\nto one\'s self as a more heinous sin than that committed against one\'s\r\nneighbour. He may have in view the fact that none harm their neighbours\r\nso much as they who are oblivious of their own true interest.\r\n\r\n[382] _Sodom and Cahors_: Sins against nature are reckoned sins against\r\nGod, as explained lower down in this Canto. Cahors in Languedoc had in\r\nthe Middle Ages the reputation of being a nest of usurers. These in old\r\nEnglish Chronicles are termed Caorsins. With the sins of Sodom and\r\nCahors are ranked the denial of God and blasphemy against Him--deeper\r\nsins than the erroneous conceptions of the Divine nature and government\r\npunished in the Sixth Circle. The three concentric rings composing the\r\nSeventh Circle are all on the same level, as we shall find.\r\n\r\n[383] _Fraud, etc._: Fraud is of such a nature that conscience never\r\nfails to give due warning against the sin. This is an aggravation of the\r\nguilt of it.\r\n\r\n[384] _The second circle_: The second now beneath them; that is, the\r\nEighth.\r\n\r\n[385] _Seat of Dis_: The Ninth and last Circle.\r\n\r\n[386] _Thy Ethics_: The Ethics of Aristotle, in which it is said: \'With\r\nregard to manners, these three things are to be eschewed: incontinence,\r\nvice, and bestiality.\' Aristotle holds incontinence to consist in the\r\nimmoderate indulgence of propensities which under right guidance are\r\nadapted to promote lawful pleasure. It is, generally speaking, the sin\r\nof which those about whom Dante has inquired were guilty.--It has been\r\ningeniously sought by Philalethes (_G\xc3\xb6tt. Com._) to show that Virgil\'s\r\ndisquisition is founded on this threefold classification of\r\nAristotle\'s--violence being taken to be the same as bestiality, and\r\nmalice as vice. But the reference to Aristotle is made with the limited\r\npurpose of justifying the lenient treatment of incontinence; in the same\r\nway as a few lines further on Genesis is referred to in support of the\r\nharsh treatment of usury.\r\n\r\n[387] _Physics_: The Physics of Aristotle, in which it is said: \'Art\r\nimitates nature.\' Art includes handicrafts.\r\n\r\n[388] _Genesis_: \'And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the\r\ngarden to dress it and to keep it.\' \'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou\r\neat bread.\'\r\n\r\n[389] _His disdain_: The usurer seeks to get wealth independently of\r\nhonest labour or reliance on the processes of nature. This far-fetched\r\nargument against usury closes one of the most arid passages of the\r\n_Comedy_. The shortness of the Canto almost suggests that Dante had\r\nhimself got weary of it.\r\n\r\n[390] _But come, etc._: They have been all this time resting behind the\r\nlid of the tomb.\r\n\r\n[391] _The Fishes, etc._: The sun being now in Aries the stars of Pisces\r\nbegin to rise about a couple of hours before sunrise. The Great Bear\r\nlies above Caurus, the quarter of the N.N.W. wind. It seems impossible\r\nto harmonise the astronomical indications scattered throughout the\r\n_Comedy_, there being traces of Dante\'s having sometimes used details\r\nbelonging rather to the day on which Good Friday fell in 1300, the 8th\r\nof April, than to the (supposed) true anniversary of the crucifixion.\r\nThat this, the 25th of March, is the day he intended to conform to\r\nappears from _Inf._ xxi. 112.--The time is now near dawn on the Saturday\r\nmorning. It is almost needless to say that Virgil speaks of the stars as\r\nhe knows they are placed, but without seeing them. By what light they\r\nsee in Inferno is nowhere explained. We have been told that it was dark\r\nas night (_Inf._ iv. 10, v. 28).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The place of our descent[392] before us lay\r\n    Precipitous, and there was something more\r\n    From sight of which all eyes had turned away.\r\n  As at the ruin which upon the shore\r\n    Of Adige[393] fell upon this side of Trent--\r\n    Through earthquake or by slip of what before\r\n  Upheld it--from the summit whence it went\r\n    Far as the plain, the shattered rocks supply\r\n    Some sort of foothold to who makes descent;\r\n  Such was the passage down the precipice high.                     10\r\n    And on the riven gully\'s very brow\r\n    Lay spread at large the Cretan Infamy[394]\r\n  Which was conceived in the pretended cow.\r\n    Us when he saw, he bit himself for rage\r\n    Like one whose anger gnaws him through and through.\r\n  \'Perhaps thou deemest,\' called to him the Sage,\r\n    \'This is the Duke of Athens[395] drawing nigh,\r\n    Who war to the death with thee on earth did wage.\r\n  Begone, thou brute, for this one passing by\r\n    Untutored by thy sister has thee found,                         20\r\n    And only comes thy sufferings to spy,\'\r\n  And as the bull which snaps what held it bound\r\n    On being smitten by the fatal blow,\r\n    Halts in its course, and reels upon the ground,\r\n  The Minotaur I saw reel to and fro;\r\n    And he, the alert, cried: \'To the passage haste;\r\n    While yet he chafes \'twere well thou down shouldst go.\'\r\n  So we descended by the slippery waste[396]\r\n    Of shivered stones which many a time gave way\r\n    \'Neath the new weight[397] my feet upon them placed.            30\r\n  I musing went; and he began to say:\r\n    \'Perchance this ruined slope thou thinkest on,\r\n    Watched by the brute rage I did now allay.\r\n  But I would have thee know, when I came down\r\n    The former time[398] into this lower Hell,\r\n    The cliff had not this ruin undergone.\r\n  It was not long, if I distinguish well,\r\n    Ere He appeared who wrenched great prey from Dis[399]\r\n    From out the upmost circle. Trembling fell\r\n  Through all its parts the nauseous abyss                          40\r\n    With such a violence, the world, I thought,\r\n    Was stirred by love; for, as they say, by this\r\n  She back to Chaos[400] has been often brought.\r\n    And then it was this ancient rampart strong\r\n    Was shattered here and at another spot.[401]\r\n  But toward the valley look. We come ere long\r\n    Down to the river of blood[402] where boiling lie\r\n    All who by violence work others wrong.\'\r\n  O insane rage! O blind cupidity!\r\n    By which in our brief life we are so spurred,                   50\r\n    Ere downward plunged in evil case for aye!\r\n  An ample ditch I now beheld engird\r\n    And sweep in circle all around the plain,\r\n    As from my Escort I had lately heard.\r\n  Between this and the rock in single train\r\n    Centaurs[403] were running who were armed with bows,\r\n    As if they hunted on the earth again.\r\n  Observing us descend they all stood close,\r\n    Save three of them who parted from the band\r\n    With bow, and arrows they in coming chose.                      60\r\n  \'What torment,\' from afar one made demand,\r\n    \'Come ye to share, who now descend the hill?\r\n    I shoot unless ye answer whence ye stand.\'\r\n  My Master said: \'We yield no answer till\r\n    We come to Chiron[404] standing at thy side;\r\n    But thy quick temper always served thee ill.\'\r\n  Then touching me: \'\'Tis Nessus;[405] he who died\r\n    With love for beauteous Dejanire possessed,\r\n    And who himself his own vendetta plied.\r\n  He in the middle, staring on his breast,                          70\r\n    Is mighty Chiron, who Achilles bred;\r\n    And next the wrathful Pholus. They invest\r\n  The fosse and in their thousands round it tread,\r\n    Shooting whoever from the blood shall lift,\r\n    More than his crime allows, his guilty head.\'\r\n  As we moved nearer to those creatures swift\r\n    Chiron drew forth a shaft and dressed his beard\r\n    Back on his jaws, using the arrow\'s cleft.\r\n  And when his ample mouth of hair was cleared,\r\n    He said to his companions: \'Have ye seen                        80\r\n    The things the second touches straight are stirred,\r\n  As they by feet of shades could ne\'er have been?\'\r\n    And my good Guide, who to his breast had gone--\r\n    The part where join the natures,[406] \'Well I ween\r\n  He lives,\' made answer; \'and if, thus alone,\r\n    He seeks the valley dim \'neath my control,\r\n    Necessity, not pleasure, leads him on.\r\n  One came from where the alleluiahs roll,\r\n    Who charged me with this office strange and new:\r\n    No robber he, nor mine a felon soul.                            90\r\n  But, by that Power which makes me to pursue\r\n    The rugged journey whereupon I fare,\r\n    Accord us one of thine to keep in view,\r\n  That he may show where lies the ford, and bear\r\n    This other on his back to yonder strand;\r\n    No spirit he, that he should cleave the air.\'\r\n  Wheeled to the right then Chiron gave command\r\n    To Nessus: \'Turn, and lead them, and take tent\r\n    They be not touched by any other band.\'[407]\r\n  We with our trusty Escort forward went,                          100\r\n    Threading the margin of the boiling blood\r\n    Where they who seethed were raising loud lament.\r\n  People I saw up to the chin imbrued,\r\n    \'These all are tyrants,\' the great Centaur said,\r\n    \'Who blood and plunder for their trade pursued.\r\n  Here for their pitiless deeds tears now are shed\r\n    By Alexander,[408] and Dionysius fell,\r\n    Through whom in Sicily dolorous years were led.\r\n  The forehead with black hair so terrible\r\n    Is Ezzelino;[409] that one blond of hue,                       110\r\n    Obizzo[410] d\'Este, whom, as rumours tell,\r\n  His stepson murdered, and report speaks true.\'\r\n    I to the Poet turned, who gave command:\r\n    \'Regard thou chiefly him. I follow you.\'\r\n  Ere long the Centaur halted on the strand,\r\n    Close to a people who, far as the throat,\r\n    Forth of that bulicam\xc3\xab[411] seemed to stand.\r\n  Thence a lone shade to us he pointed out\r\n    Saying: \'In God\'s house[412] ran he weapon through\r\n    The heart which still on Thames wins cult devout.\'             120\r\n  Then I saw people, some with heads in view,\r\n    And some their chests above the river bore;\r\n    And many of them I, beholding, knew.\r\n  And thus the blood went dwindling more and more,\r\n    Until at last it covered but the feet:\r\n    Here took we passage[413] to the other shore.\r\n  \'As on this hand thou seest still abate\r\n    In depth the volume of the boiling stream,\'\r\n    The Centaur said, \'so grows its depth more great,\r\n  Believe me, towards the opposite extreme,                        130\r\n    Until again its circling course attains\r\n    The place where tyrants must lament. Supreme\r\n  Justice upon that side involves in pains,\r\n    With Attila,[414] once of the world the pest,\r\n    Pyrrhus[415] and Sextus: and for ever drains\r\n  Tears out of Rinier of Corneto[416] pressed\r\n    And Rinier Pazzo[417] in that boiling mass,\r\n    Whose brigandage did so the roads infest.\'\r\n  Then turned he back alone, the ford to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[392] _Our descent_: To the Seventh Circle.\r\n\r\n[393] _Adige_: Different localities in the valley of the Adige have been\r\nfixed on as the scene of this landslip. The Lavini di Marco, about\r\ntwenty miles south of Trent, seem best to answer to the description.\r\nThey \'consist of black blocks of stone and fragments of a landslip\r\nwhich, according to the Chronicle of Fulda, fell in the year 883 and\r\noverwhelmed the valley for four Italian miles\' (Gsell-Fels, _Ober.\r\nItal._ i. 35).\r\n\r\n[394] _The Cretan Infamy_: The Minotaur, the offspring of Pasipha\xc3\xab; a\r\nhalf-bovine monster who inhabited the Cretan labyrinth, and to whom a\r\nhuman victim was offered once a year. He lies as guard upon the Seventh\r\nCircle--that of the violent (_Inf._ xi. 23, _note_)--and is set at the\r\ntop of the rugged slope, itself the scene of a violent convulsion.\r\n\r\n[395] _Duke of Athens_: Theseus, instructed by Ariadne, daughter of\r\nPasipha\xc3\xab and Minos, how to outwit the Minotaur, entered the labyrinth in\r\nthe character of a victim, slew the monster, and then made his way out,\r\nguided by a thread he had unwound as he went in.\r\n\r\n[396] _The slippery waste_: The word used here, _scarco_, means in\r\nmodern Tuscan a place where earth or stones have been carelessly shot\r\ninto a heap.\r\n\r\n[397] _The new weight_: The slope had never before been trodden by\r\nmortal foot.\r\n\r\n[398] _The former time_: When Virgil descended to evoke a shade from the\r\nNinth Circle (_Inf._ ix. 22).\r\n\r\n[399] _Prey from Dis_: The shades delivered from Limbo by Christ (_Inf._\r\niv. 53). The expression in the text is probably suggested by the words\r\nof the hymn _Vexilla: Pr\xc3\xa6damque tulit Tartaris_.\r\n\r\n[400] _To Chaos_: The reference is to the theory of Empedocles, known to\r\nDante through the refutation of it by Aristotle. The theory was one of\r\nperiods of unity and division in nature, according as love or hatred\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\n[401] _Another spot_: See _Inf._ xxi. 112. The earthquake at the\r\nCrucifixion shook even Inferno to its base.\r\n\r\n[402] _The river of blood_: Phlegethon, the \'boiling river.\' Styx and\r\nAcheron have been already passed. Lethe, the fourth infernal river, is\r\nplaced by Dante in Purgatory. The first round or circlet of the Seventh\r\nCircle is filled by Phlegethon.\r\n\r\n[403] _Centaurs_: As this round is the abode of such as are guilty of\r\nviolence against their neighbours, it is guarded by these brutal\r\nmonsters, half-man and half-horse.\r\n\r\n[404] _Chiron_: Called the most just of the Centaurs.\r\n\r\n[405] _Nessus_: Slain by Hercules with a poisoned arrow. When dying he\r\ngave Dejanira his blood-stained shirt, telling her it would insure the\r\nfaithfulness to her of any whom she loved. Hercules wore it and died of\r\nthe venom; and thus Nessus avenged himself.\r\n\r\n[406] The natures: The part of the Centaur where the equine body is\r\njoined on to the human neck and head.\r\n\r\n[407] _Other band_: Of Centaurs.\r\n\r\n[408] _Alexander_: It is not known whether Alexander the Great or a\r\npetty Thessalian tyrant is here meant. _Dionysius_: The cruel tyrant of\r\nSyracuse.\r\n\r\n[409] _Ezzelino_: Or Azzolino of Romano, the greatest Lombard Ghibeline\r\nof his time. He was son-in-law of Frederick II., and was Imperial Vicar\r\nof the Trevisian Mark. Towards the close of Fredrick\'s life, and for\r\nsome years after, he exercised almost independent power in Vicenza,\r\nPadua, and Verona. Cruelty, erected into a system, was his chief\r\ninstrument of government, and \'in his dungeons men found something worse\r\nthan death.\' For Italians, says Burckhardt, he was the most impressive\r\npolitical personage of the thirteenth century; and around his memory, as\r\naround Frederick\'s, there gathered strange legends. He died in 1259, of\r\na wound received in battle. When urged to confess his sins by the monk\r\nwho came to shrive him, he declared that the only sin on his conscience\r\nwas negligence in revenge. But this may be mythical, as may also be the\r\nlong black hair between his eyebrows, which rose up stiff and terrible\r\nas his anger waxed.\r\n\r\n[410] _Obizzo_: The second Marquis of Este of that name. He was lord of\r\nFerrara. There seems little, if any, evidence extant of his being\r\nspecially cruel. As a strong Guelf he took sides with Charles of Anjou\r\nagainst Manfred. He died in 1293, smothered, it was believed, by a son,\r\nhere called a stepson for his unnatural conduct. But though Dante\r\nvouches for the truth of the rumour it seems to have been an invention.\r\n\r\n[411] _That bulicam\xc3\xab_: The stream of boiling blood is probably named\r\nfrom the bulicam\xc3\xab, or hot spring, best known to Dante--that near Viterbo\r\n(see _Inf._ xiv. 79). And it may be that the mention of the bulicam\xc3\xab\r\nsuggests the reference at line 119.\r\n\r\n[412] _In God\'s house_: Literally, \'In the bosom of God.\' The shade is\r\nthat of Guy, son of Simon of Montfort and Vicar in Tuscany of Charles of\r\nAnjou. In 1271 he stabbed, in the Cathedral of Viterbo, Henry, son of\r\nRichard of Cornwall and cousin of Edward I. of England. The motive of\r\nthe murder was to revenge the death of his father, Simon, at Evesham.\r\nThe body of the young prince was conveyed to England, and the heart was\r\nplaced in a vase upon the tomb of the Confessor. The shade of Guy stands\r\nup to the chin in blood among the worst of the tyrants, and alone,\r\nbecause of the enormity of his crime.\r\n\r\n[413] _Here took we passage_: Dante on Nessus\' back. Virgil has fallen\r\nbehind to allow the Centaur to act as guide; and how he crosses the\r\nstream Dante does not see.\r\n\r\n[414] _Attila_: King of the Huns, who invaded part of Italy in the fifth\r\ncentury; and who, according to the mistaken belief of Dante\'s age, was\r\nthe devastator of Florence.\r\n\r\n[415] _Pyrrhus_: King of Epirus. _Sextus_: Son of Pompey; a great\r\nsea-captain who fought against the Triumvirs. The crime of the first, in\r\nDante\'s eyes, is that he fought with Rome; of the second, that he\r\nopposed Augustus.\r\n\r\n[416] _Rinier of Corneto_: Who in Dante\'s time disturbed the coast of\r\nthe States of the Church by his robberies and violence.\r\n\r\n[417] _Rinier Pazzo_: Of the great family of the Pazzi of Val d\'Arno,\r\nwas excommunicated in 1269 for robbing ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ere Nessus landed on the other shore\r\n    We for our part within a forest[418] drew,\r\n    Which of no pathway any traces bore.\r\n  Not green the foliage, but of dusky hue;\r\n    Not smooth the boughs, but gnarled and twisted round;\r\n    For apples, poisonous thorns upon them grew.\r\n  No rougher brakes or matted worse are found\r\n    Where savage beasts betwixt Corneto[419] roam\r\n    And Cecina,[419] abhorring cultured ground.\r\n  The loathsome Harpies[420] nestle here at home,                   10\r\n    Who from the Strophades the Trojans chased\r\n    With dire predictions of a woe to come.\r\n  Great winged are they, but human necked and faced,\r\n    With feathered belly, and with claw for toe;\r\n    They shriek upon the bushes wild and waste.\r\n  \'Ere passing further, I would have thee know,\'\r\n    The worthy Master thus began to say,\r\n    \'Thou\'rt in the second round, nor hence shalt go\r\n  Till by the horrid sand thy footsteps stay.\r\n    Give then good heed, and things thou\'lt recognise               20\r\n    That of my words will prove[421] the verity.\'\r\n  Wailings on every side I heard arise:\r\n    Of who might raise them I distinguished nought;\r\n    Whereon I halted, smitten with surprise.\r\n  I think he thought that haply \'twas my thought\r\n    The voices came from people \'mong the trees,\r\n    Who, to escape us, hiding-places sought;\r\n  Wherefore the Master said: \'From one of these\r\n    Snap thou a twig, and thou shalt understand\r\n    How little with thy thought the fact agrees.\'                   30\r\n  Thereon a little I stretched forth my hand\r\n    And plucked a tiny branch from a great thorn.\r\n    \'Why dost thou tear me?\' made the trunk demand.\r\n  When dark with blood it had begun to turn,\r\n    It cried a second time: \'Why wound me thus?\r\n    Doth not a spark of pity in thee burn?\r\n  Though trees we be, once men were all of us;\r\n    Yet had our souls the souls of serpents been\r\n    Thy hand might well have proved more piteous.\'\r\n  As when the fire hath seized a fagot green                        40\r\n    At one extremity, the other sighs,\r\n    And wind, escaping, hisses; so was seen,\r\n  At where the branch was broken, blood to rise\r\n    And words were mixed with it. I dropped the spray\r\n    And stood like one whom terror doth surprise.\r\n  The Sage replied: \'Soul vexed with injury,\r\n    Had he been only able to give trust\r\n    To what he read narrated in my lay,[422]\r\n  His hand toward thee would never have been thrust.\r\n    \'Tis hard for faith; and I, to make it plain,                   50\r\n    Urged him to trial, mourn it though I must.\r\n  But tell him who thou wast; so shall remain\r\n    This for amends to thee, thy fame shall blow\r\n    Afresh on earth, where he returns again.\'\r\n  And then the trunk: \'Thy sweet words charm me so,\r\n    I cannot dumb remain; nor count it hard\r\n    If I some pains upon my speech bestow.\r\n  For I am he[423] who held both keys in ward\r\n    Of Frederick\'s heart, and turned them how I would,\r\n    And softly oped it, and as softly barred,                       60\r\n  Till scarce another in his counsel stood.\r\n    To my high office I such loyalty bore,\r\n    It cost me sleep and haleness of my blood.\r\n  The harlot[424] who removeth nevermore\r\n    From C\xc3\xa6sar\'s house eyes ignorant of shame--\r\n    A common curse, of courts the special sore--\r\n  Set against me the minds of all aflame,\r\n    And these in turn Augustus set on fire,\r\n    Till my glad honours bitter woes became.\r\n  My soul, filled full with a disdainful ire,                       70\r\n    Thinking by means of death disdain to flee,\r\n    \'Gainst my just self unjustly did conspire.\r\n  I swear even by the new roots of this tree\r\n    My fealty to my lord I never broke,\r\n    For worthy of all honour sure was he.\r\n  If one of you return \'mong living folk,\r\n    Let him restore my memory, overthrown\r\n    And suffering yet because of envy\'s stroke.\'\r\n  Still for a while the poet listened on,\r\n    Then said: \'Now he is dumb, lose not the hour,                  80\r\n    But make request if more thou\'dst have made known.\'\r\n  And I replied: \'Do thou inquire once more\r\n    Of what thou thinkest[425] I would gladly know;\r\n    I cannot ask; ruth wrings me to the core.\'\r\n  On this he spake: \'Even as the man shall do,\r\n    And liberally, what thou of him hast prayed,\r\n    Imprisoned spirit, do thou further show\r\n  How with these knots the spirits have been made\r\n    Incorporate; and, if thou canst, declare\r\n    If from such members e\'er is loosed a shade.\'                   90\r\n  Then from the trunk came vehement puffs of air;\r\n    Next, to these words converted was the wind:\r\n    \'My answer to you shall be short and clear.\r\n  When the fierce soul no longer is confined\r\n    In flesh, torn thence by action of its own,\r\n    To the Seventh Depth by Minos \'tis consigned.\r\n  No choice is made of where it shall be thrown\r\n    Within the wood; but where by chance \'tis flung\r\n    It germinates like seed of spelt that\'s sown.\r\n  A forest tree it grows from sapling young;                       100\r\n    Eating its leaves, the Harpies cause it pain,\r\n    And open loopholes whence its sighs are wrung.\r\n  We for our vestments shall return again\r\n    Like others, but in them shall ne\'er be clad:[426]\r\n    Men justly lose what from themselves they\'ve ta\'en.\r\n  Dragged hither by us, all throughout the sad\r\n    Forest our bodies shall be hung on high;\r\n    Each on the thorn of its destructive shade.\'\r\n  While to the trunk we listening lingered nigh,\r\n    Thinking he might proceed to tell us more,                     110\r\n    A sudden uproar we were startled by\r\n  Like him who, that the huntsman and the boar\r\n    To where he stands are sweeping in the chase,\r\n    Knows by the crashing trees and brutish roar.\r\n  Upon our left we saw a couple race\r\n    Naked[427] and scratched; and they so quickly fled\r\n    The forest barriers burst before their face.\r\n  \'Speed to my rescue, death!\' the foremost pled.\r\n    The next, as wishing he could use more haste;\r\n    \'Not thus, O Lano,[428] thee thy legs bested                   120\r\n  When one at Toppo\'s tournament thou wast.\'\r\n    Then, haply wanting breath, aside he stepped,\r\n    Merged with a bush on which himself he cast.\r\n  Behind them through the forest onward swept\r\n    A pack of dogs, black, ravenous, and fleet,\r\n    Like greyhounds from their leashes newly slipped.\r\n  In him who crouched they made their teeth to meet,\r\n    And, having piecemeal all his members rent,\r\n    Haled them away enduring anguish great.\r\n  Grasping my hand, my Escort forward went                         130\r\n    And led me to the bush which, all in vain,\r\n    Through its ensanguined openings made lament.\r\n  \'James of St. Andrews,\'[429] it we heard complain;\r\n    \'What profit hadst thou making me thy shield?\r\n    For thy bad life doth blame to me pertain?\'\r\n  Then, halting there, this speech my Master held:\r\n    \'Who wast thou that through many wounds dost sigh,\r\n    Mingled with blood, words big with sorrow swelled?\'\r\n  \'O souls that hither come,\' was his reply,\r\n    \'To witness shameful outrage by me borne,                      140\r\n    Whence all my leaves torn off around me lie,\r\n  Gather them to the root of this drear thorn.\r\n    My city[430] for the Baptist changed of yore\r\n    Her former patron; wherefore, in return,\r\n  He with his art will make her aye deplore;\r\n    And were it not some image doth remain\r\n    Of him where Arno\'s crossed from shore to shore,\r\n  Those citizens who founded her again\r\n    On ashes left by Attila,[431] had spent\r\n    Their labour of a surety all in vain.                          150\r\n  In my own house[432] I up a gibbet went.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[418] _A forest_: The second round of the Seventh Circle consists of a\r\nbelt of tangled forest, enclosed by the river of blood, and devoted to\r\nsuicides and prodigals.\r\n\r\n[419] _Corneto and Cecina_: Corneto is a town on the coast of what used\r\nto be the States of the Church; Cecina a stream not far south of\r\nLeghorn. Between them lies the Maremma, a district of great natural\r\nfertility, now being restored again to cultivation, but for ages a\r\nneglected and poisonous wilderness.\r\n\r\n[420] _Harpies_: Monsters with the bodies of birds and the heads of\r\nwomen. In the _\xc3\x86neid_ iii., they are described as defiling the feast of\r\nwhich the Trojans were about to partake on one of the\r\nStrophades--islands of the \xc3\x86gean; and on that occasion the prophecy was\r\nmade that \xc3\x86neas and his followers should be reduced to eat their tables\r\nere they acquired a settlement in Italy. Here the Harpies symbolise\r\nshameful waste and disgust with life.\r\n\r\n[421] _Will prove, etc._: The things seen by Dante are to make credible\r\nwhat Virgil tells (_\xc3\x86n._ iii.) of the blood and piteous voice that\r\nissued from the torn bushes on the tomb of Polydorus.\r\n\r\n[422] _My lay_: See previous note. Dante thus indirectly acknowledges\r\nhis debt to Virgil; and, perhaps, at the same time puts in his claim to\r\nan imaginative licence equal to that taken by his master. On a modern\r\nreader the effect of the reference is to weaken the verisimilitude of\r\nthe incident.\r\n\r\n[423] _For I am he, etc._: The speaker is Pier delle Vigne, who from\r\nbeing a begging student of Bologna rose to be the Chancellor of the\r\nEmperor Frederick II., the chief councillor of that monarch, and one of\r\nthe brightest ornaments of his intellectual court. Peter was perhaps the\r\nmore endeared to his master because, like him, he was a poet of no mean\r\norder. There are two accounts of what caused his disgrace. According to\r\none of these he was found to have betrayed Frederick\'s interests in\r\nfavour of the Pope\'s; and according to the other he tried to poison him.\r\nNeither is it known whether he committed suicide; though he is said to\r\nhave done so after being disgraced, by dashing his brains out against a\r\nchurch wall in Pisa. Dante clearly follows this legend. The whole\r\nepisode is eloquent of the esteem in which Peter\'s memory was held by\r\nDante. His name is not mentioned in Inferno, but yet the promise is\r\namply kept that it shall flourish on earth again, freed from unmerited\r\ndisgrace. He died about 1249.\r\n\r\n[424] _The harlot_: Envy.\r\n\r\n[425] _Of what thou thinkest, etc._: Virgil never asks a question for\r\nhis own satisfaction. He knows who the spirits are, what brought them\r\nthere, and which of them will speak honestly out on the promise of\r\nhaving his fame refreshed in the world. It should be noted how, by a\r\nhint, he has made Peter aware of who he is (line 48); a delicate\r\nattention yielded to no other shade in the Inferno, except Ulysses\r\n(_Inf._ xxvi. 79), and, perhaps, Brunetto Latini (_Inf._ xv. 99).\r\n\r\n[426] _In them shall ne\'er be clad_: Boccaccio is here at great pains to\r\nsave Dante from a charge of contradicting the tenet of the resurrection\r\nof the flesh.\r\n\r\n[427] _Naked_: These are the prodigals; their nakedness representing the\r\nstate to which in life they had reduced themselves.\r\n\r\n[428] _Lano_: Who made one of a club of prodigals in Siena (_Inf._ xxix.\r\n130) and soon ran through his fortune. Joining in a Florentine\r\nexpedition in 1288 against Arezzo, he refused to escape from a defeat\r\nencountered by his side at Pieve del Toppo, preferring, as was supposed,\r\nto end his life at once rather than drag it out in poverty.\r\n\r\n[429] _James of St. Andrews_: Jacopo da Sant\' Andrea, a Paduan who\r\ninherited enormous wealth which did not last him for long. He literally\r\nthrew money away, and would burn a house for the sake of the blaze. His\r\ndeath has been placed in 1239.\r\n\r\n[430] _My city, etc._: According to tradition the original patron of\r\nFlorence was Mars. In Dante\'s time an ancient statue, supposed to be of\r\nthat god, stood upon the Old Bridge of Florence. It is referred to in\r\n_Parad._ xvi. 47 and 145. Benvenuto says that he had heard from\r\nBoccaccio, who had frequently heard it from old people, that the statue\r\nwas regarded with great awe. If a boy flung stones or mud at it, the\r\nbystanders would say of him that he would make a bad end. It was lost in\r\nthe great flood of 1333. Here the Florentine shade represents Mars as\r\ntroubling Florence with wars in revenge for being cast off as a patron.\r\n\r\n[431] _Attila_: A confusion with Totila. Attila was never so far south\r\nas Tuscany. Neither is there reason to believe that when Totila took the\r\ncity he destroyed it. But the legend was that it was rebuilt in the time\r\nof Charles the Great.\r\n\r\n[432] _My own house, etc._: It is not settled who this was who hanged\r\nhimself from the beams of his own roof. One of the Agli, say some;\r\nothers, one of the Mozzi. Boccaccio and Peter Dante remark that suicide\r\nby hanging was common in Florence. But Dante\'s text seems pretty often\r\nto have suggested the invention of details in support or illustration of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Me of my native place the dear constraint[433]\r\n    Led to restore the leaves which round were strewn,\r\n    To him whose voice by this time was grown faint.\r\n  Thence came we where the second round joins on\r\n    Unto the third, wherein how terrible\r\n    The art of justice can be, is well shown.\r\n  But, clearly of these wondrous things to tell,\r\n    I say we entered on a plain of sand\r\n    Which from its bed doth every plant repel.\r\n  The dolorous wood lies round it like a band,                      10\r\n    As that by the drear fosse is circled round.\r\n    Upon its very edge we came to a stand.\r\n  And there was nothing within all that bound\r\n    But burnt and heavy sand; like that once trod\r\n    Beneath the feet of Cato[434] was the ground.\r\n  Ah, what a terror, O revenge of God!\r\n    Shouldst thou awake in any that may read\r\n    Of what before mine eyes was spread abroad.\r\n  I of great herds of naked souls took heed.\r\n    Most piteously was weeping every one;                           20\r\n    And different fortunes seemed to them decreed.\r\n  For some of them[435] upon the ground lay prone,\r\n    And some were sitting huddled up and bent,\r\n    While others, restless, wandered up and down.\r\n  More numerous were they that roaming went\r\n    Than they that were tormented lying low;\r\n    But these had tongues more loosened to lament.\r\n  O\'er all the sand, deliberate and slow,\r\n    Broad open flakes of fire were downward rained,\r\n    As \'mong the Alps[436] in calm descends the snow.               30\r\n  Such Alexander[437] saw when he attained\r\n    The hottest India; on his host they fell\r\n    And all unbroken on the earth remained;\r\n  Wherefore he bade his phalanxes tread well\r\n    The ground, because when taken one by one\r\n    The burning flakes they could the better quell.\r\n  So here eternal fire[438] was pouring down;\r\n    As tinder \'neath the steel, so here the sands\r\n    Kindled, whence pain more vehement was known.\r\n  And, dancing up and down, the wretched hands[439]                 40\r\n    Beat here and there for ever without rest;\r\n    Brushing away from them the falling brands.\r\n  And I: \'O Master, by all things confessed\r\n    Victor, except by obdurate evil powers\r\n    Who at the gate[440] to stop our passage pressed,\r\n  Who is the enormous one who noway cowers\r\n    Beneath the fire; with fierce disdainful air\r\n    Lying as if untortured by the showers?\'\r\n  And that same shade, because he was aware\r\n    That touching him I of my Guide was fain                        50\r\n    To learn, cried: \'As in life, myself I bear\r\n  In death. Though Jupiter should tire again\r\n    His smith, from whom he snatched in angry bout\r\n    The bolt by which I at the last was slain;[441]\r\n  Though one by one he tire the others out\r\n    At the black forge in Mongibello[442] placed,\r\n    While "Ho, good Vulcan, help me!" he shall shout--\r\n  The cry he once at Phlegra\'s[443] battle raised;\r\n    Though hurled with all his might at me shall fly\r\n    His bolts, yet sweet revenge he shall not taste.\'               60\r\n  Then spake my Guide, and in a voice so high\r\n    Never till then heard I from him such tone:\r\n    \'O Capaneus, because unquenchably\r\n  Thy pride doth burn, worse pain by thee is known.\r\n    Into no torture save thy madness wild\r\n    Fit for thy fury couldest thou be thrown.\'\r\n  Then, to me turning with a face more mild,\r\n    He said: \'Of the Seven Kings was he of old,\r\n    Who leaguered Thebes, and as he God reviled\r\n  Him in small reverence still he seems to hold;                    70\r\n    But for his bosom his own insolence\r\n    Supplies fit ornament,[444] as now I told.\r\n  Now follow; but take heed lest passing hence\r\n    Thy feet upon the burning sand should tread;\r\n    But keep them firm where runs the forest fence.\'[445]\r\n  We reached a place--nor any word we said--\r\n    Where issues from the wood a streamlet small;\r\n    I shake but to recall its colour red.\r\n  Like that which does from Bulicam\xc3\xab[446] fall,\r\n    And losel women later \'mong them share;                         80\r\n    So through the sand this brooklet\'s waters crawl.\r\n  Its bottom and its banks I was aware\r\n    Were stone, and stone the rims on either side.\r\n    From this I knew the passage[447] must be there.\r\n  \'Of all that I have shown thee as thy guide\r\n    Since when we by the gateway[448] entered in,\r\n    Whose threshold unto no one is denied,\r\n  Nothing by thee has yet encountered been\r\n    So worthy as this brook to cause surprise,\r\n    O\'er which the falling fire-flakes quenched are seen.\'          90\r\n  These were my Leader\'s words. For full supplies\r\n    I prayed him of the food of which to taste\r\n    Keen appetite he made within me rise.\r\n  \'In middle sea there lies a country waste,\r\n    Known by the name of Crete,\' I then was told,\r\n    \'Under whose king[449] the world of yore was chaste.\r\n  There stands a mountain, once the joyous hold\r\n    Of woods and streams; as Ida \'twas renowned,\r\n    Now \'tis deserted like a thing grown old.\r\n  For a safe cradle \'twas by Rhea found.                           100\r\n    To nurse her child[450] in; and his infant cry,\r\n  Lest it betrayed him, she with clamours drowned.\r\n  Within the mount an old man towereth high.\r\n    Towards Damietta are his shoulders thrown;\r\n    On Rome, as on his mirror, rests his eye.\r\n  His head is fashioned of pure gold alone;\r\n    Of purest silver are his arms and chest;\r\n    \'Tis brass to where his legs divide; then down\r\n  From that is all of iron of the best,\r\n    Save the right foot, which is of baken clay;                   110\r\n    And upon this foot doth he chiefly rest.\r\n  Save what is gold, doth every part display\r\n    A fissure dripping tears; these, gathering all\r\n    Together, through the grotto pierce a way.\r\n  From rock to rock into this deep they fall,\r\n    Feed Acheron[451] and Styx and Phlegethon,\r\n    Then downward travelling by this strait canal,\r\n  Far as the place where further slope is none,\r\n    Cocytus form; and what that pool may be\r\n    I say not now. Thou\'lt see it further on.\'                     120\r\n  \'If this brook rises,\' he was asked by me,\r\n    \'Within our world, how comes it that no trace\r\n    We saw of it till on this boundary?\'\r\n  And he replied: \'Thou knowest that the place\r\n    Is round, and far as thou hast moved thy feet,\r\n    Still to the left hand[452] sinking to the base,\r\n  Nath\'less thy circuit is not yet complete.\r\n    Therefore if something new we chance to spy,\r\n    Amazement needs not on thy face have seat.\'\r\n  I then: \'But, Master, where doth Lethe lie,                      130\r\n    And Phlegethon? Of that thou sayest nought;\r\n    Of this thou say\'st, those tears its flood supply.\'\r\n  \'It likes me well to be by thee besought;\r\n    But by the boiling red wave,\' I was told,\r\n    \'To half thy question was an answer brought.\r\n  Lethe,[453] not in this pit, shalt thou behold.\r\n    Thither to wash themselves the spirits go,\r\n    When penitence has made them spotless souled.\'\r\n  Then said he: \'From the wood \'tis fitting now\r\n    That we depart; behind me press thou nigh.                     140\r\n    Keep we the margins, for they do not glow,\r\n  And over them, ere fallen, the fire-flakes die.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[433] _Dear constraint_: The mention of Florence has awakened Dante to\r\npity, and he willingly complies with the request of the unnamed suicide\r\n(_Inf._ xiii. 142). As a rule, the only service he consents to yield the\r\nsouls with whom he converses in Inferno is to restore their memory upon\r\nearth; a favour he does not feign to be asked for in this case, out of\r\nconsideration, it may be, for the family of the sinner.\r\n\r\n[434] _Cato_: Cato of Utica, who, after the defeat of Pompey at\r\nPharsalia, led his broken army across the Libyan desert to join King\r\nJuba.\r\n\r\n[435] _Some of them, etc._: In this the third round of the Seventh\r\nCircle are punished those guilty of sins of violence against God,\r\nagainst nature, and against the arts by which alone a livelihood can\r\nhonestly be won. Those guilty as against God, the blasphemers, lie prone\r\nlike Capaneus (line 46), and are subject to the fiercest pain. Those\r\nguilty of unnatural vice are stimulated into ceaseless motion, as\r\ndescribed in Cantos XV. and XVI. The usurers, those who despise honest\r\nindustry and the humanising arts of life, are found crouching on the\r\nground (_Inf._ xvii. 43).\r\n\r\n[436] _The Alps_: Used here for mountains in general.\r\n\r\n[437] _Such Alexander, etc._: The reference is to a pretended letter of\r\nAlexander to Aristotle, in which he tells of the various hindrances met\r\nwith by his army from snow and rain and showers of fire. But in that\r\nnarrative it is the snow that is trampled down, while the flakes of fire\r\nare caught by the soldiers upon their outspread cloaks. The story of the\r\nshower of fire may have been suggested by Plutarch\'s mention of the\r\nmineral oil in the province of Babylon, a strange thing to the Greeks;\r\nand of how they were entertained by seeing the ground, which had been\r\nsprinkled with it, burst into flame.\r\n\r\n[438] _Eternal fire_: As always, the character of the place and of the\r\npunishment bears a relation to the crimes of the inhabitants. They\r\nsinned against nature in a special sense, and now they are confined to\r\nthe sterile sand where the only showers that fall are showers of fire.\r\n\r\n[439] _The wretched hands_: The dance, named in the original the\r\n_tresca_, was one in which the performers followed a leader and imitated\r\nhim in all his gestures, waving their hands as he did, up and down, and\r\nfrom side to side. The simile is caught straight from common life.\r\n\r\n[440] _At the gate_: Of the city of Dis (_Inf._ viii. 82).\r\n\r\n[441] _Was slain, etc._: Capaneus, one of the Seven Kings, as told\r\nbelow, when storming the walls of Thebes, taunted the other gods with\r\nimpunity, but his blasphemy against Jupiter was answered by a fatal\r\nbolt.\r\n\r\n[442] _Mongibello_: A popular name of Etna, under which mountain was\r\nsituated the smithy of Vulcan and the Cyclopes.\r\n\r\n[443] _Phlegra_: Where the giants fought with the gods.\r\n\r\n[444] _Fit ornament, etc._: Even if untouched by the pain he affects to\r\ndespise, he would yet suffer enough from the mad hatred of God that\r\nrages in his breast. Capaneus is the nearest approach to the Satan of\r\nMilton found in the _Inferno_. From the need of getting law enough by\r\nwhich to try the heathen Dante is led into some inconsistency. After\r\ncondemning the virtuous heathen to Limbo for their ignorance of the one\r\ntrue God, he now condemns the wicked heathen to this circle for\r\ndespising false gods. Jupiter here stands for, as need scarcely be said,\r\nthe Supreme Ruler; and in that sense he is termed God (line 69). But it\r\nremains remarkable that the one instance of blasphemous defiance of God\r\nshould be taken from classical fable.\r\n\r\n[445] _The forest fence_: They do not trust themselves so much as to\r\nstep upon the sand, but look out on it from the verge of the forest\r\nwhich encircles it, and which as they travel they have on the left hand.\r\n\r\n[446] _Bulicam\xc3\xab_: A hot sulphur spring a couple of miles from Viterbo,\r\ngreatly frequented for baths in the Middle Ages; and, it is said,\r\nespecially by light women. The water boils up into a large pool, whence\r\nit flows by narrow channels; sometimes by one and sometimes by another,\r\nas the purposes of the neighbouring peasants require. Sulphurous fumes\r\nrise from the water as it runs. The incrustation of the bottom, sides,\r\nand edges of those channels gives them the air of being solidly built.\r\n\r\n[447] _The passage_: On each edge of the canal there is a flat pathway\r\nof solid stone; and Dante sees that only by following one of these can a\r\npassage be gained across the desert, for to set foot on the sand is\r\nimpossible for him owing to the falling flakes of fire. There may be\r\nfound in his description of the solid and flawless masonry of the canal\r\na trace of the pleasure taken in good building by the contemporaries of\r\nArnolfo. Nor is it without meaning that the sterile sands, the abode of\r\nsuch as despised honest labour, is crossed by a perfect work of art\r\nwhich they are forbidden ever to set foot upon.\r\n\r\n[448] _The gateway_: At the entrance to Inferno.\r\n\r\n[449] _Whose king_: Saturn, who ruled the world in the Golden Age. He,\r\nas the devourer of his own offspring, is the symbol of Time; and the\r\nimage of Time is therefore set by Dante in the island where he reigned.\r\n\r\n[450] _Her child_: Jupiter, hidden in the mountain from his father\r\nSaturn.\r\n\r\n[451] _Feed Acheron, etc._: The idea of this image is taken from the\r\nfigure in Nebuchadnezzar\'s dream in Daniel ii. But here, instead of the\r\nFour Empires, the materials of the statue represent the Four Ages of the\r\nworld; the foot of clay on which it stands being the present time, which\r\nis so bad that even iron were too good to represent it. Time turns his\r\nback to the outworn civilisations of the East, and his face to Rome,\r\nwhich, as the seat of the Empire and the Church, holds the secret of the\r\nfuture. The tears of time shed by every Age save that of Gold feed the\r\nfour infernal streams and pools of Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, and\r\nCocytus. Line 117 indicates that these are all fed by the same water;\r\nare in fact different names for the same flood of tears. The reason why\r\nDante has not hitherto observed the connection between them is that he\r\nhas not made a complete circuit of each or indeed of any circle, as\r\nVirgil reminds him at line 124, etc. The rivulet by which they stand\r\ndrains the boiling Phlegethon--where the water is all changed to blood,\r\nbecause in it the murderers are punished--and flowing through the forest\r\nof the suicides and the desert of the blasphemers, etc., tumbles into\r\nthe Eighth Circle as described in Canto xvi. 103. Cocytus they are\r\nafterward to reach. An objection to this account of the infernal rivers\r\nas being all fed by the same waters may be found in the difference of\r\nvolume of the great river of Acheron (_Inf._ iii. 71) and of this\r\nbrooklet. But this difference is perhaps to be explained by the\r\nevaporation from the boiling waters of Phlegethon and of this stream\r\nwhich drains it. Dante is almost the only poet applied to whom such\r\ncriticism would not be trifling. Another difficult point is how Cocytus\r\nshould not in time have filled, and more than filled, the Ninth Circle.\r\n\r\n[452] _To the left hand_: Twice only as they descend they turn their\r\ncourse to the right hand (_Inf._ ix. 132, and xvii. 31). The circuit of\r\nthe Inferno they do not complete till they reach the very base.\r\n\r\n[453] _Lethe_: Found in the Earthly Paradise, as described in\r\n_Purgatorio_ xxviii. 130.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now lies[454] our way along one of the margins hard;\r\n    Steam rising from the rivulet forms a cloud,\r\n    Which \'gainst the fire doth brook and borders guard.\r\n  Like walls the Flemings, timorous of the flood\r\n    Which towards them pours betwixt Bruges and Cadsand,[455]\r\n    Have made, that ocean\'s charge may be withstood;\r\n  Or what the Paduans on the Brenta\'s strand\r\n    To guard their castles and their homesteads rear,\r\n    Ere Chiarentana[456] feel the spring-tide bland;\r\n  Of the same fashion did those dikes appear,                       10\r\n    Though not so high[457] he made them, nor so vast,\r\n    Whoe\'er the builder was that piled them here.\r\n  We, from the wood when we so far had passed\r\n    I should not have distinguished where it lay\r\n    Though I to see it backward glance had cast,\r\n  A group of souls encountered on the way,\r\n    Whose line of march was to the margin nigh.\r\n    Each looked at us--as by the new moon\'s ray\r\n  Men peer at others \'neath the darkening sky--\r\n    Sharpening his brows on us and only us,                         20\r\n    Like an old tailor on his needle\'s eye.\r\n  And while that crowd was staring at me thus,\r\n    One of them knew me, caught me by the gown,\r\n    And cried aloud: \'Lo, this is marvellous!\'[458]\r\n  And straightway, while he thus to me held on,\r\n    I fixed mine eyes upon his fire-baked face,\r\n    And, spite of scorching, seemed his features known,\r\n  And whose they were my memory well could trace;\r\n    And I, with hand[459] stretched toward his face below,\r\n    Asked: \'Ser Brunetto![460] and is this your place?\'             30\r\n  \'O son,\' he answered, \'no displeasure show,\r\n    If now Brunetto Latini shall some way\r\n    Step back with thee, and leave his troop to go.\'\r\n  I said: \'With all my heart for this I pray,\r\n    And, if you choose, I by your side will sit;\r\n    If he, for I go with him, grant delay.\'\r\n  \'Son,\' said he, \'who of us shall intermit\r\n    Motion a moment, for an age must lie\r\n    Nor fan himself when flames are round him lit.\r\n  On, therefore! At thy skirts I follow nigh,                       40\r\n    Then shall I overtake my band again,\r\n    Who mourn a loss large as eternity.\'\r\n  I dared not from the path step to the plain\r\n    To walk with him, but low I bent my head,[461]\r\n    Like one whose steps are all with reverence ta\'en.\r\n  \'What fortune or what destiny,\' he said,\r\n    \'Hath brought thee here or e\'er thou death hast seen;\r\n    And who is this by whom thou\'rt onward led?\'\r\n  \'Up yonder,\' said I, \'in the life serene,\r\n    I in a valley wandered all forlorn                              50\r\n    Before my years had full accomplished been.\r\n  I turned my back on it but yestermorn;[462]\r\n    Again I sought it when he came in sight\r\n    Guided by whom[463] I homeward thus return.\'\r\n  And he to me: \'Following thy planet\'s light[464]\r\n    Thou of a glorious haven canst not fail,\r\n    If in the blithesome life I marked aright.\r\n  And had my years known more abundant tale,\r\n    Seeing the heavens so held thee in their grace\r\n    I, heartening thee, had helped thee to prevail.                 60\r\n  But that ungrateful and malignant race\r\n    Which down from Fiesole[465] came long ago,\r\n    And still its rocky origin betrays,\r\n  Will for thy worthiness become thy foe;\r\n    And with good reason, for \'mong crab-trees wild\r\n    It ill befits the mellow fig to grow.\r\n  By widespread ancient rumour are they styled\r\n    A people blind, rapacious, envious, vain:\r\n    See by their manners thou be not defiled.\r\n  Fortune reserves such honour for thee, fain                       70\r\n    Both sides[466] will be to enlist thee in their need;\r\n    But from the beak the herb shall far remain.\r\n  Let beasts of Fiesole go on to tread\r\n    Themselves to litter, nor the plants molest,\r\n    If any such now spring on their rank bed,\r\n  In whom there flourishes indeed the blest\r\n    Seed of the Romans who still lingered there\r\n    When of such wickedness \'twas made the nest.\'\r\n  \'Had I obtained full answer to my prayer,\r\n    You had not yet been doomed,\' I then did say,                   80\r\n    \'This exile from humanity to bear.\r\n  For deep within my heart and memory\r\n    Lives the paternal image good and dear\r\n    Of you, as in the world, from day to day,\r\n  How men escape oblivion you made clear;\r\n    My thankfulness for which shall in my speech\r\n    While I have life, as it behoves, appear.\r\n  I note what of my future course you teach.\r\n    Stored with another text[467] it will be glozed\r\n    By one expert, should I that Lady reach.                        90\r\n  Yet would I have this much to you disclosed:\r\n    If but my conscience no reproaches yield,\r\n    To all my fortune is my soul composed.\r\n  Not new to me the hint by you revealed;\r\n    Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel apace,\r\n    Even as she will; the clown[468] his mattock wield.\'\r\n  Thereon my Master right about[469] did face,\r\n    And uttered this, with glance upon me thrown:\r\n    \'He hears[470] to purpose who doth mark the place.\'\r\n  And none the less I, speaking, still go on                       100\r\n    With Ser Brunetto; asking him to tell\r\n    Who of his band[471] are greatest and best known.\r\n  And he to me: \'To hear of some is well,\r\n    But of the rest \'tis fitting to be dumb,\r\n    And time is lacking all their names to spell.\r\n  That all of them were clerks, know thou in sum,\r\n    All men of letters, famous and of might;\r\n    Stained with one sin[472] all from the world are come.\r\n  Priscian[473] goes with that crowd of evil plight,\r\n    Francis d\'Accorso[474] too; and hadst thou mind                110\r\n    For suchlike trash thou mightest have had sight\r\n  Of him the Slave[475] of Slaves to change assigned\r\n    From Arno\'s banks to Bacchiglione, where\r\n    His nerves fatigued with vice he left behind.\r\n  More would I say, but neither must I fare\r\n    Nor talk at further length, for from the sand\r\n    I see new dust-clouds[476] rising in the air,\r\n  I may not keep with such as are at hand.\r\n    Care for my _Treasure_;[477] for I still survive\r\n    In that my work. I nothing else demand.\'                       120\r\n  Then turned he back, and ran like those who strive\r\n    For the Green Cloth[478] upon Verona\'s plain;\r\n    And seemed like him that shall the first arrive,\r\n  And not like him that labours all in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[454] _Now lies, etc._: The stream on issuing from the wood flows right\r\nacross the waste of sand which that encompasses. To follow it they must\r\nturn to the right, as always when, their general course being to the\r\nleft, they have to cross a Circle. But such a veering to the right is a\r\nconsequence of their leftward course, and not an exception to it.\r\n\r\n[455] _Cadsand_: An island opposite to the mouth of the great canal of\r\nBruges.\r\n\r\n[456] _Chiarentana_: What district or mountain is here meant has been\r\nmuch disputed. It can be taken for Carinthia only on the supposition\r\nthat Dante was ignorant of where the Brenta rises. At the source of that\r\nriver stands the Monte Chiarentana, but it may be a question how old\r\nthat name is. The district name of it is Canzana, or Carenzana.\r\n\r\n[457] _Not so high, etc._: This limitation is very characteristic of\r\nDante\'s style of thought, which compels him to a precision that will\r\nproduce the utmost possible effect of verisimilitude in his description.\r\nMost poets would have made the walls far higher and more vast, by way of\r\nlending grandeur to the conception.\r\n\r\n[458] _Marvellous_: To find Dante, whom he knew, still living, and\r\npassing through the Circle.\r\n\r\n[459] _With hand, etc._: \'With my face bent to his\' is another reading,\r\nbut there seems to be most authority for that in the text.--The fiery\r\nshower forbids Dante to stoop over the edge of the causeway. To\r\nBrunetto, who is some feet below him, he throws out his open hand, a\r\ngesture of astonishment mingled with pity.\r\n\r\n[460] _Ser Brunetto_: Brunetto Latini, a Florentine, was born in 1220.\r\nAs a notary he was entitled to be called Ser, or Messer. As appears from\r\nthe context, Dante was under great intellectual obligations to him, not,\r\nwe may suppose, as to a tutor so much as to an active-minded and\r\nscholarly friend of mature age, and possessed of a ripe experience of\r\naffairs. The social respect that Dante owed him is indicated by the use\r\nof the plural form of address. See note, _Inf._ x. 51. Brunetto held\r\nhigh appointments in the Republic. Perhaps with some exaggeration,\r\nVillani says of him that he was the first to refine the Florentines,\r\nteaching them to speak correctly, and to administer State affairs on\r\nfixed principles of politics (_Cronica_, viii. 10). A Guelf in politics,\r\nhe shared in the exile of his party after the Ghibeline victory of\r\nMontaperti in 1260, and for some years resided in Paris. There is reason\r\nto suppose that he returned to Florence in 1269, and that he acted as\r\nprothonotary of the court of Charles of Valois\' vicar-general in\r\nTuscany. His signature as secretary to the Council of Florence is found\r\nunder the date of 1273. He died in 1294, when Dante was twenty-nine, and\r\nwas buried in the cloister of Santa Maria Maggiore, where his tombstone\r\nmay still be seen. (Not in Santa Maria Novella.) Villani mentions him in\r\nhis Chronicle with some reluctance, seeing he was a \'worldly man.\' His\r\nlife must indeed have been vicious to the last, before Dante could have\r\nhad the heart to fix him in such company. Brunetto\'s chief works are the\r\n_Tesoro_ and _Tesoretto_. For the _Tesoro_, see note at line 119. The\r\n_Tesoretto_, or _Little Treasure_, is an allegorical poem in Italian\r\nrhymed couplets. In it he imagines himself, as he is on his return from\r\nan embassy to Alphonso of Castile, meeting a scholar of Bologna of whom\r\nhe asks \'in smooth sweet words for news of Tuscany.\' Having been told of\r\nthe catastrophe of Montaperti he wanders out of the beaten way into the\r\nForest of Roncesvalles, where he meets with various experiences; he is\r\nhelped by Ovid, is instructed by Ptolemy, and grows penitent for his\r\nsins. In this, it will be seen, there is a general resemblance to the\r\naction of the _Comedy_. There are even turns of expression that recall\r\nDante (_e.g._ beginning of _Cap._ iv.); but all together amounts to\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n[461] _Low I bent my head_: But not projecting it beyond the line of\r\nsafety, strictly defined by the edge of the causeway. We are to imagine\r\nto ourselves the fire of Sodom falling on Brunetto\'s upturned face, and\r\nmissing Dante\'s head only by an inch.\r\n\r\n[462] _Yestermorn_: This is still the Saturday. It was Friday when Dante\r\nmet Virgil.\r\n\r\n[463] _Guided by whom_: Brunetto has asked who the guide is, and Dante\r\ndoes not tell him. A reason for the refusal has been ingeniously found\r\nin the fact that among the numerous citations of the _Treasure_ Brunetto\r\nseldom quotes Virgil. See also the charge brought against Guido\r\nCavalcanti (_Inf._ x. 63), of holding Virgil in disdain. But it is\r\nexplanation enough of Dante\'s omission to name his guide that he is\r\npassing through Inferno to gain experience for himself, and not to\r\nsatisfy the curiosity of the shades he meets. See note on line 99.\r\n\r\n[464] _Thy planet\'s light_: Some think that Brunetto had cast Dante\'s\r\nhoroscope. In a remarkable passage (_Parad._ xxii. 112) Dante attributes\r\nany genius he may have to the influence of the Twins, which\r\nconstellation was in the ascendant when he was born. See also _Inf._\r\nxxvi. 23. But here it is more likely that Brunetto refers to his\r\nobservation of Dante\'s good qualities, from which he gathered that he\r\nwas well starred.\r\n\r\n[465] _Fiesole_: The mother city of Florence, to which also most of the\r\nFiesolans were believed to have migrated at the beginning of the\r\neleventh century. But all the Florentines did their best to establish a\r\nRoman descent for themselves; and Dante among them. His fellow-citizens\r\nhe held to be for the most part of the boorish Fiesolan breed, rude and\r\nstony-hearted as the mountain in whose cleft the cradle of their race\r\nwas seen from Florence.\r\n\r\n[466] _Both sides_: This passage was most likely written not long after\r\nDante had ceased to entertain any hope of winning his way back to\r\nFlorence in the company of the Whites, whose exile he shared, and when\r\nhe was already standing in proud isolation from Black and White, from\r\nGuelf and Ghibeline. There is nothing to show that his expectation of\r\nbeing courted by both sides ever came true. Never a strong partisan, he\r\nhad, to use his own words, at last to make a party by himself, and stood\r\nout an Imperialist with his heart set on the triumph of an Empire far\r\nnobler than that the Ghibeline desired. Dante may have hoped to hold a\r\nplace of honour some day in the council of a righteous Emperor; and this\r\nmay be the glorious haven with the dream of which he was consoled in the\r\nwanderings of his exile.\r\n\r\n[467] _Another text_: Ciacco and Farinata have already hinted at the\r\ntroubles that lie ahead of him (_Inf._ vi. 65, and x. 79).\r\n\r\n[468] _The clown, etc._: The honest performance of duty is the best\r\ndefence against adverse fortune.\r\n\r\n[469] _Right about_: In traversing the sands they keep upon the\r\nright-hand margin of the embanked stream, Virgil leading the way, with\r\nDante behind him on the right so that Brunetto may see and hear him\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[470] _He hears, etc._: Of all the interpretations of this somewhat\r\nobscure sentence that seems the best which applies it to Virgil\'s\r\n_Quicquid erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est_--\'Whatever shall\r\nhappen, every fate is to be vanquished by endurance\' (_\xc3\x86n._ v. 710).\r\nTaking this way of it, we have in the form of Dante\'s profession of\r\nindifference to all the adverse fortune that may be in store for him a\r\nrefined compliment to his Guide; and in Virgil\'s gesture and words an\r\nequally delicate revelation of himself to Brunetto, in which is conveyed\r\nan answer to the question at line 48, \'Who is this that shows the\r\nway?\'--Otherwise, the words convey Virgil\'s approbation of Dante\'s\r\nhaving so well attended to his advice to store Farinata\'s prophecy in\r\nhis memory (_Inf._ x.127).\r\n\r\n[471] _His band_: That is, the company to which Brunetto specially\r\nbelongs, and from which for the time he has separated himself.\r\n\r\n[472] _Stained with one sin_: Dante will not make Brunetto individually\r\nconfess his sin.\r\n\r\n[473] _Priscian_: The great grammarian of the sixth century; placed here\r\nwithout any reason, except that he is a representative teacher of youth.\r\n\r\n[474] _Francis d\'Accorso_: Died about 1294. The son of a great civil\r\nlawyer, he was himself professor of the civil law at Bologna, where his\r\nservices were so highly prized that the Bolognese forbade him, on pain\r\nof the confiscation of his goods, to accept an invitation from Edward I.\r\nto go to Oxford.\r\n\r\n[475] _Of him the Slave, etc._: One of the Pope\'s titles is _Servus\r\nServorum Domini_. The application of it to Boniface, so hated by Dante,\r\nmay be ironical: \'Fit servant of such a slave to vice!\' The priest\r\nreferred to so contemptuously is Andrea, of the great Florentine family\r\nof the Mozzi, who was much engaged in the political affairs of his time,\r\nand became Bishop of Florence in 1286. About ten years later he was\r\ntranslated to Vicenza, which stands on the Bacchiglione; and he died\r\nshortly afterwards. According to Benvenuto he was a ridiculous preacher\r\nand a man of dissolute manners. What is now most interesting about him\r\nis that he was Dante\'s chief pastor during his early manhood, and is\r\nconsigned by him to the same disgraceful circle of Inferno as his\r\nbeloved master Brunetto Latini--a terrible evidence of the corruption of\r\nlife among the churchmen as well as the scholars of the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[476] _New dust-clouds_: Raised by a band by whom they are about to be\r\nmet.\r\n\r\n[477] _My Treasure_: The _Tr\xc3\xa9sor_, or _Tesoro_, Brunetto\'s principal\r\nwork, was written by him in French as being \'the pleasantest language,\r\nand the most widely spread.\' In it he treats of things in general in the\r\nencyclopedic fashion set him by Alphonso of Castile. The first half\r\nconsists of a summary of civil and natural history. The second is\r\ndevoted to ethics, rhetoric, and politics. To a great extent it is a\r\ncompilation, containing, for instance, a translation, nearly complete,\r\nof the Ethics of Aristotle--not, of course, direct from the Greek. It is\r\nwritten in a plodding style, and speaks to more industry than genius. To\r\nit Dante is indebted for some facts and fables.\r\n\r\n[478] _The Green Cloth_: To commemorate a victory won by the Veronese\r\nthere was instituted a race to be run on the first Sunday of Lent. The\r\nprize was a piece of green cloth. The competitors ran naked.--Brunetto\r\ndoes not disappear into the gloom without a parting word of applause\r\nfrom his old pupil. Dante\'s rigorous sentence on his beloved master is\r\npronounced as softly as it can be. We must still wonder that he has the\r\nheart to bring him to such an awful judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now could I hear the water as it fell\r\n    To the next circle[479] with a murmuring sound\r\n    Like what is heard from swarming hives to swell;\r\n  When three shades all together with a bound\r\n    Burst from a troop met by us pressing on\r\n    \'Neath rain of that sharp torment. O\'er the ground\r\n  Toward us approaching, they exclaimed each one:\r\n    \'Halt thou, whom from thy garb[480] we judge to be\r\n    A citizen of our corrupted town.\'\r\n  Alas, what scars I on their limbs did see,                        10\r\n    Both old and recent, which the flames had made:\r\n    Even now my ruth is fed by memory.\r\n  My Teacher halted at their cry, and said:\r\n    \'Await a while:\' and looked me in the face;\r\n    \'Some courtesy to these were well displayed.\r\n  And but that fire--the manner of the place--\r\n    Descends for ever, fitting \'twere to find\r\n    Rather than them, thee quickening thy pace.\'\r\n  When we had halted, they again combined\r\n    In their old song; and, reaching where we stood,                20\r\n    Into a wheel all three were intertwined.\r\n  And as the athletes used, well oiled and nude,\r\n    To feel their grip and, wary, watch their chance,\r\n    Ere they to purpose strike and wrestle could;\r\n  So each of them kept fixed on me his glance\r\n    As he wheeled round,[481] and in opposing ways\r\n    His neck and feet seemed ever to advance.\r\n  \'Ah, if the misery of this sand-strewn place\r\n    Bring us and our petitions in despite,\'\r\n    One then began, \'and flayed and grimy face;                     30\r\n  Let at the least our fame goodwill incite\r\n    To tell us who thou art, whose living feet\r\n    Thus through Inferno wander without fright.\r\n  For he whose footprints, as thou see\'st, I beat,\r\n    Though now he goes with body peeled and nude,\r\n    More than thou thinkest, in the world was great.\r\n  The grandson was he of Gualdrada good;\r\n    He, Guidoguerra,[482] with his arm\xc3\xa8d hand\r\n    Did mighty things, and by his counsel shrewd.\r\n  The other who behind me treads the sand                           40\r\n    Is one whose name should on the earth be dear;\r\n    For he is Tegghiaio[483] Aldobrand.\r\n  And I, who am tormented with them here,\r\n    James Rusticucci[484] was; my fierce and proud\r\n    Wife of my ruin was chief minister.\'\r\n  If from the fire there had been any shroud\r\n    I should have leaped down \'mong them, nor have earned\r\n    Blame, for my Teacher sure had this allowed.\r\n  But since I should have been all baked and burned,\r\n    Terror prevailed the goodwill to restrain                       50\r\n    With which to clasp them in my arms I yearned.\r\n  Then I began: \'\'Twas not contempt but pain\r\n    Which your condition in my breast awoke,\r\n    Where deeply rooted it will long remain,\r\n  When this my Master words unto me spoke,\r\n    By which expectancy was in me stirred\r\n    That ye who came were honourable folk.\r\n  I of your city[485] am, and with my word\r\n    Your deeds and honoured names oft to recall\r\n    Delighted, and with joy of them I heard.                        60\r\n  To the sweet fruits I go, and leave the gall,\r\n    As promised to me by my Escort true;\r\n    But first I to the centre down must fall.\'\r\n  \'So may thy soul thy members long endue\r\n    With vital power,\' the other made reply,\r\n    \'And after thee thy fame[486] its light renew;\r\n  As thou shalt tell if worth and courtesy\r\n    Within our city as of yore remain,\r\n    Or from it have been wholly forced to fly.\r\n  For William Borsier,[487] one of yonder train,                    70\r\n    And but of late joined with us in this woe,\r\n    Causeth us with his words exceeding pain.\'\r\n  \'Upstarts, and fortunes suddenly that grow,\r\n    Have bred in thee pride and extravagance,[488]\r\n    Whence tears, O Florence! thou art shedding now.\'\r\n  Thus cried I with uplifted countenance.\r\n    The three, accepting it for a reply,\r\n    Glanced each at each as hearing truth men glance.\r\n  And all: \'If others thou shalt satisfy\r\n    As well at other times[489] at no more cost,                    80\r\n    Happy thus at thine ease the truth to cry!\r\n  Therefore if thou escap\'st these regions lost,\r\n    Returning to behold the starlight fair,\r\n    Then when "There was I,"[490] thou shalt make thy boast,\r\n  Something of us do thou \'mong men declare.\'\r\n    Then broken was the wheel, and as they fled\r\n    Their nimble legs like pinions beat the air.\r\n  So much as one _Amen!_ had scarce been said\r\n    Quicker than what they vanished from our view.\r\n    On this once more the way my Master led.                        90\r\n  I followed, and ere long so near we drew\r\n    To where the water fell, that for its roar\r\n    Speech scarcely had been heard between us two.\r\n  And as the stream which of all those which pour\r\n    East (from Mount Viso counting) by its own\r\n    Course falls the first from Apennine to shore--\r\n  As Acquacheta[491] in the uplands known\r\n    By name, ere plunging to its bed profound;\r\n    Name lost ere by Forl\xc3\xac its waters run--\r\n  Above St. Benedict with one long bound,                          100\r\n    Where for a thousand[492] would be ample room,\r\n    Falls from the mountain to the lower ground;\r\n  Down the steep cliff that water dyed in gloom\r\n    We found to fall echoing from side to side,\r\n    Stunning the ear with its tremendous boom.\r\n  There was a cord about my middle tied,\r\n    With which I once had thought that I might hold\r\n    Secure the leopard with the painted hide.\r\n  When this from round me I had quite unrolled\r\n    To him I handed it, all coiled and tight;                      110\r\n    As by my Leader I had first been told.\r\n  Himself then bending somewhat toward the right,[493]\r\n    He just beyond the edge of the abyss\r\n    Threw down the cord,[494] which disappeared from sight.\r\n  \'That some strange thing will follow upon this\r\n    Unwonted signal which my Master\'s eye\r\n    Thus follows,\' so I thought, \'can hardly miss.\'\r\n  Ah, what great caution need we standing by\r\n    Those who behold not only what is done,\r\n    But who have wit our hidden thoughts to spy!                   120\r\n  He said to me: \'There shall emerge, and soon,\r\n    What I await; and quickly to thy view\r\n    That which thou dream\'st of shall be clearly known.\'[495]\r\n  From utterance of truth which seems untrue\r\n    A man, whene\'er he can, should guard his tongue;\r\n    Lest he win blame to no transgression due.\r\n  Yet now I must speak out, and by the song\r\n    Of this my Comedy, Reader, I swear--\r\n    So in good liking may it last full long!--\r\n  I saw a shape swim upward through that air.                      130\r\n    All indistinct with gross obscurity,\r\n    Enough to fill the stoutest heart with fear:\r\n  Like one who rises having dived to free\r\n    An anchor grappled on a jagged stone,\r\n    Or something else deep hidden in the sea;\r\n  With feet drawn in and arms all open thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[479] _The next circle_: The Eighth.\r\n\r\n[480] _Thy garb_: \'Almost every city,\' says Boccaccio, \'had in those\r\ntimes its peculiar fashion of dress distinct from that of neighboring\r\ncities.\'\r\n\r\n[481] _As he wheeled round_: Virgil and Dante have come to a halt upon\r\nthe embankment. The three shades, to whom it is forbidden to be at rest\r\nfor a moment, clasping one another as in a dance, keep wheeling round in\r\ncircle upon the sand.\r\n\r\n[482] _Guidoguerra_: A descendant of the Counts Guidi of Modigliana.\r\nGualdrada was the daughter of Bellincion Berti de\' Ravignani, praised\r\nfor his simple habits in the _Paradiso_, xv. 112. Guidoguerra was a\r\nGuelf leader, and after the defeat of Montaperti acted as Captain of his\r\nparty, in this capacity lending valuable aid to Charles of Anjou at the\r\nbattle of Benevento, 1266, when Manfred was overthrown. He had no\r\nchildren, and left the Commonwealth of Florence his heir.\r\n\r\n[483] _Tegghiaio_: Son of Aldobrando of the Adimari. His name should be\r\ndear in Florence, because he did all he could to dissuade the citizens\r\nfrom the campaign which ended so disastrously at Montaperti.\r\n\r\n[484] _James Rusticucci_: An accomplished cavalier of humble birth, said\r\nto have been a retainer of Dante\'s friends the Cavalcanti. The\r\ncommentators have little to tell of him except that he made an unhappy\r\nmarriage, which is evident from the text. Of the sins of him and his\r\ncompanions there is nothing known beyond what is to be inferred from the\r\npoet\'s words, and nothing to say, except that when Dante consigned men\r\nof their stamp, frank and amiable, to the Infernal Circles, we may be\r\nsure that he only executed a verdict already accepted as just by the\r\nwhole of Florence. And when we find him impartially damning Guelf and\r\nGhibeline we may be equally sure that he looked for the aid of neither\r\nparty, and of no family however powerful in the State, to bring his\r\nbanishment to a close. He would even seem to be careful to stop any hole\r\nby which he might creep back to Florence. When he did return, it was to\r\nbe in the train of the Emperor, so he hoped, and as one who gives rather\r\nthan seeks forgiveness.\r\n\r\n[485] _Of your city, etc._: At line 32 Rusticucci begs Dante to tell who\r\nhe is. He tells that he is of their city, which they have already\r\ngathered from his _berretta_ and the fashion of his gown; but he tells\r\nnothing, almost, of himself. Unless to Farinata, indeed, he never makes\r\nan open breast to any one met in Inferno. But here he does all that\r\ncourtesy requires.\r\n\r\n[486] _Thy fame_: Dante has implied in his answer that he is gifted with\r\noratorical powers and is the object of a special Divine care; and the\r\nillustrious Florentine, frankly acknowledging the claim he makes,\r\nadjures him by the fame which is his in store to appease an eager\r\ncuriosity about the Florence which even in Inferno is the first thought\r\nof every not ignoble Florentine.\r\n\r\n[487] _William Borsiere_: A Florentine, witty and well bred, according\r\nto Boccaccio. Being once at Genoa he was shown a fine new palace by its\r\nmiserly owner, and was asked to suggest a subject for a painting with\r\nwhich to adorn the hall. The subject was to be something that nobody had\r\never seen. Borsiere proposed liberality as something that the miser at\r\nany rate had never yet got a good sight of; an answer of which it is not\r\neasy to detect either the wit or the courtesy, but which is said to have\r\nconverted the churl to liberal ways (_Decam._ i. 8). He is here\r\nintroduced as an authority on the noble style of manners.\r\n\r\n[488] _Pride and extravagance_: In place of the nobility of mind that\r\nleads to great actions, and the gentle manners that prevail in a society\r\nwhere there is a due subordination of rank to rank and well-defined\r\nduties for every man. This, the aristocratic in a noble sense, was\r\nDante\'s ideal of a social state; for all his instincts were those of a\r\nFlorentine aristocrat, corrected though they were by his good sense and\r\nhis thirst for a reign of perfect justice. During his own time he had\r\nseen Florence grow more and more democratic; and he was\r\nirritated--unreasonably, considering that it was only a sign of the\r\ngeneral prosperity--at the spectacle of the amazing growth of wealth in\r\nthe hands of low-born traders, who every year were coming more to the\r\nfront and monopolising influence at home and abroad at the cost of their\r\nneighbours and rivals with longer pedigrees and shorter purses. In\r\n_Paradiso_ xvi. Dante dwells at length on the degeneracy of the\r\nFlorentines.\r\n\r\n[489] _At other times_: It is hinted that his outspokenness will not in\r\nthe future always give equal satisfaction to those who hear.\r\n\r\n[490] _There was I, etc._: _Forsan et h\xc3\xa6c olim meminisse\r\njuvabit._--_\xc3\x86n._ i. 203.\r\n\r\n[491] _Acquacheta_: The fall of the water of the brook over the lofty\r\ncliff that sinks from the Seventh to the Eighth Circle is compared to\r\nthe waterfall upon the Montone at the monastery of St. Benedict, in the\r\nmountains above Forl\xc3\xac. The Po rises in Monte Viso. Dante here travels in\r\nimagination from Monte Viso down through Italy, and finds that all the\r\nrivers which rise on the left hand, that is, on the north-east of the\r\nApennine, fall into the Po, till the Montone is reached, that river\r\nfalling into the Adriatic by a course of its own. Above Forl\xc3\xac it was\r\ncalled Acquacheta. The Lamone, north of the Montone, now follows an\r\nindependent course to the sea, having cut a new bed for itself since\r\nDante\'s time.\r\n\r\n[492] _Where for a thousand, etc._: In the monastery there was room for\r\nmany more monks, say most of the commentators; or something to the like\r\neffect. Mr. Longfellow\'s interpretation seems better: Where the height\r\nof the fall is so great that it would divide into a thousand falls.\r\n\r\n[493] _Toward the right_: The attitude of one about to throw.\r\n\r\n[494] _The cord_: The services of Geryon are wanted to convey them down\r\nthe next reach of the pit; and as no voice could be heard for the noise\r\nof the waterfall, and no signal be made to catch the eye amid the gloom,\r\nVirgil is obliged to call the attention of the monster by casting some\r\nobject into the depth where he lies concealed. But, since they are\r\nsurrounded by solid masonry and slack sand, one or other of them must\r\nsupply something fit to throw down; and the cord worn by Dante is fixed\r\non as what can best be done without. There may be a reference to the\r\ncord of Saint Francis, which Dante, according to one of his\r\ncommentators, wore when he was a young man, following in this a fashion\r\ncommon enough among pious laymen who had no thought of ever becoming\r\nfriars. But the simile of the cord, as representing sobriety and\r\nvirtuous purpose, is not strange to Dante. In _Purg._ vii. 114 he\r\ndescribes Pedro of Arragon as being girt with the cord of every virtue;\r\nand Pedro was no Franciscan. Dante\'s cord may therefore be taken as\r\nstanding for vigilance or self-control. With it he had hoped to get the\r\nbetter of the leopard (_Inf._ i. 32), and may have trusted in it for\r\nsupport as against the terrors of Inferno. But although he has been girt\r\nwith it ever since he entered by the gate, it has not saved him from a\r\nsingle fear, far less from a single danger; and now it is cast away as\r\nuseless. Henceforth, more than ever, he is to confide wholly in Virgil\r\nand have no confidence in himself. Nor is he to be girt again till he\r\nreaches the coast of Purgatory, and then it is to be with a reed, the\r\nemblem of humility.--But, however explained, the incident will always be\r\nsomewhat of a puzzle.\r\n\r\n[495] Dante attributes to Virgil full knowledge of all that is in his\r\nown mind. He thus heightens our conception of his dependence on his\r\nguide, with whose will his will is blent, and whose thoughts are always\r\nfound to be anticipating his own. Few readers will care to be constantly\r\nrecalling to mind that Virgil represents enlightened human reason. But\r\neven if we confine ourselves to the easiest sense of the narrative, the\r\nstudy of the relations between him and Dante will be found one of the\r\nmost interesting suggested by the poem--perhaps only less so than that\r\nof Dante\'s moods of wonder, anger, and pity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \'Behold the monster[496] with the pointed tail,\r\n    Who passes mountains[497] and can entrance make\r\n    Through arms and walls! who makes the whole world ail,\r\n  Corrupted by him!\' Thus my Leader spake,\r\n    And beckoned him that he should land hard by,\r\n    Where short the pathways built of marble break.\r\n  And that foul image of dishonesty\r\n    Moving approached us with his head and chest,\r\n    But to the bank[498] drew not his tail on high.\r\n  His face a human righteousness expressed,                         10\r\n    \'Twas so benignant to the outward view;\r\n    A serpent was he as to all the rest.\r\n  On both his arms hair to the arm-pits grew:\r\n    On back and chest and either flank were knot[499]\r\n    And rounded shield portrayed in various hue;\r\n  No Turk or Tartar weaver ever brought\r\n    To ground or pattern a more varied dye;[500]\r\n    Nor by Arachne[501] was such broidery wrought.\r\n  As sometimes by the shore the barges lie\r\n    Partly in water, partly on dry land;                            20\r\n    And as afar in gluttonous Germany,[502]\r\n  Watching their prey, alert the beavers stand;\r\n    So did this worst of brutes his foreparts fling\r\n    Upon the stony rim which hems the sand.\r\n  All of his tail in space was quivering,\r\n    Its poisoned fork erecting in the air,\r\n    Which scorpion-like was arm\xc3\xa8d with a sting.\r\n  My Leader said: \'Now we aside must fare\r\n    A little distance, so shall we attain\r\n    Unto the beast malignant crouching there.\'                      30\r\n  So we stepped down upon the right,[503] and then\r\n    A half score steps[504] to the outer edge did pace,\r\n    Thus clearing well the sand and fiery rain.\r\n  And when we were hard by him I could trace\r\n    Upon the sand a little further on\r\n    Some people sitting near to the abyss.\r\n  \'That what this belt containeth may be known\r\n    Completely by thee,\' then the Master said;\r\n    \'To see their case do thou advance alone.\r\n  Let thy inquiries be succinctly made.                             40\r\n    While thou art absent I will ask of him,\r\n    With his strong shoulders to afford us aid.\'\r\n  Then, all alone, I on the outmost rim\r\n    Of that Seventh Circle still advancing trod,\r\n    Where sat a woful folk.[505] Full to the brim\r\n  Their eyes with anguish were, and overflowed;\r\n    Their hands moved here and there to win some ease,\r\n    Now from the flames, now from the soil which glowed.\r\n  No otherwise in summer-time one sees,\r\n    Working its muzzle and its paws, the hound                      50\r\n    When bit by gnats or plagued with flies or fleas.\r\n  And I, on scanning some who sat around\r\n    Of those on whom the dolorous flames alight,\r\n    Could recognise[506] not one. I only found\r\n  A purse hung from the throat of every wight,\r\n    Each with its emblem and its special hue;\r\n    And every eye seemed feasting on the sight.\r\n  As I, beholding them, among them drew,\r\n    I saw what seemed a lion\'s face and mien\r\n    Upon a yellow purse designed in blue.                           60\r\n  Still moving on mine eyes athwart the scene\r\n    I saw another scrip, blood-red, display\r\n    A goose more white than butter could have been.\r\n  And one, on whose white wallet blazoned lay\r\n    A pregnant sow[507] in azure, to me said:\r\n    \'What dost thou in this pit? Do thou straightway\r\n  Begone; and, seeing thou art not yet dead,\r\n    Know that Vitalian,[508] neighbour once of mine,\r\n    Shall on my left flank one day find his bed.\r\n  A Paduan I: all these are Florentine;                             70\r\n    And oft they stun me, bellowing in my ear:\r\n    "Come, Pink of Chivalry,[509] for whom we pine,\r\n  Whose is the purse on which three beaks appear:"\'\r\n    Then he from mouth awry his tongue thrust out[510]\r\n    Like ox that licks its nose; and I, in fear\r\n  Lest more delay should stir in him some doubt\r\n    Who gave command I should not linger long,\r\n    Me from those wearied spirits turned about.\r\n  I found my Guide, who had already sprung\r\n    Upon the back of that fierce animal:                            80\r\n    He said to me: \'Now be thou brave and strong.\r\n  By stairs like this[511] we henceforth down must fall.\r\n    Mount thou in front, for I between would sit\r\n    So thee the tail shall harm not nor appal.\'\r\n  Like one so close upon the shivering fit\r\n    Of quartan ague that his nails grow blue,\r\n    And seeing shade he trembles every whit,\r\n  I at the hearing of that order grew;\r\n    But his threats shamed me, as before the face\r\n    Of a brave lord his man grows valorous too.                     90\r\n  On the great shoulders then I took my place,\r\n    And wished to say, but could not move my tongue\r\n    As I expected: \'Do thou me embrace!\'\r\n  But he, who other times had helped me \'mong\r\n    My other perils, when ascent I made\r\n    Sustained me, and strong arms around me flung,\r\n  And, \'Geryon, set thee now in motion!\' said;\r\n    \'Wheel widely; let thy downward flight be slow;\r\n    Think of the novel burden on thee laid.\'\r\n  As from the shore a boat begins to go                            100\r\n    Backward at first, so now he backward pressed,\r\n    And when he found that all was clear below,\r\n  He turned his tail where earlier was his breast;\r\n    And, stretching it, he moved it like an eel,\r\n    While with his paws he drew air toward his chest.\r\n  More terror Pha\xc3\xabthon could hardly feel\r\n    What time he let the reins abandoned fall,\r\n    Whence Heaven was fired,[512] as still its tracts reveal;\r\n  Nor wretched Icarus, on finding all\r\n    His plumage moulting as the wax grew hot,                      110\r\n    While, \'The wrong road!\' his father loud did call;\r\n  Than what I felt on finding I was brought\r\n    Where nothing was but air and emptiness;\r\n    For save the brute I could distinguish nought.\r\n  He slowly, slowly swims; to the abyss\r\n    Wheeling he makes descent, as I surmise\r\n    From wind felt \'neath my feet and in my face.\r\n  Already on the right I heard arise\r\n    From out the caldron a terrific roar,[513]\r\n    Whereon I stretch my head with down-turned eyes.               120\r\n  Terror of falling now oppressed me sore;\r\n    Hearing laments, and seeing fires that burned,\r\n    My thighs I tightened, trembling more and more.\r\n  Earlier I had not by the eye discerned\r\n    That we swept downward; scenes of torment now\r\n    Seemed drawing nearer wheresoe\'er we turned.\r\n  And as a falcon (which long time doth go\r\n    Upon the wing, not finding lure[514] or prey),\r\n    While \'Ha!\' the falconer cries, \'descending so!\'\r\n  Comes wearied back whence swift it soared away;                  130\r\n    Wheeling a hundred times upon the road,\r\n    Then, from its master far, sulks angrily:\r\n  So we, by Geryon in the deep bestowed,\r\n    Were \'neath the sheer-hewn precipice set down:\r\n    He, suddenly delivered from our load,\r\n  Like arrow from the string was swiftly gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[496] _The monster_: Geryon, a mythical king of Spain, converted here\r\ninto the symbol of fraud, and set as the guardian demon of the Eighth\r\nCircle, where the fraudulent are punished. There is nothing in the\r\nmythology to justify this account of Geryon; and it seems that Dante has\r\ncreated a monster to serve his purpose. Boccaccio, in his _Genealogy of\r\nthe Gods_ (Lib. i.), repeats the description of Geryon given by \'Dante\r\nthe Florentine, in his poem written in the Florentine tongue, one\r\ncertainly of no little importance among poems;\' and adds that Geryon\r\nreigned in the Balearic Isles, and was used to decoy travellers with his\r\nbenignant countenance, caressing words, and every kind of friendly lure,\r\nand then to murder them when asleep.\r\n\r\n[497] _Who passes mountains, etc._: Neither art nor nature affords any\r\ndefence against fraud.\r\n\r\n[498] _The bank_: Not that which confines the brook but the inner limit\r\nof the Seventh Circle, from which the precipice sinks sheer into the\r\nEighth, and to which the embankment by which the travellers have crossed\r\nthe sand joins itself on. Virgil has beckoned Geryon to come to that\r\npart of the bank which adjoins the end of the causeway.\r\n\r\n[499] _Knot and rounded shield_: Emblems of subtle devices and\r\nsubterfuges.\r\n\r\n[500]_ Varied dye_: Denoting the various colours of deceit.\r\n\r\n[501] _Arachne_: The Lydian weaver changed into a spider by Minerva. See\r\n_Purg._ xii. 43.\r\n\r\n[502] _Gluttonous Germany_: The habits of the German men-at-arms in\r\nItaly, odious to the temperate Italians, explains this gibe.\r\n\r\n[503] _The right_: This is the second and last time that, in their\r\ncourse through Inferno, they turn to the right. See _Inf._ ix. 132. The\r\naction may possibly have a symbolical meaning, and refer to the\r\nprotection against fraud which is obtained by keeping to a righteous\r\ncourse. But here, in fact, they have no choice, for, traversing the\r\nInferno as they do to the left hand, they came to the right bank of the\r\nstream which traverses the fiery sands, followed it, and now, when they\r\nwould leave its edge, it is from the right embankment that they have to\r\nstep down, and necessarily to the right hand.\r\n\r\n[504] _A half score steps, etc._: Traversing the stone-built border\r\nwhich lies between the sand and the precipice. Had the brook flowed to\r\nthe very edge of the Seventh Circle before tumbling down the rocky wall\r\nit is clear that they might have kept to the embankment until they were\r\nclear beyond the edge of the sand. We are therefore to figure to\r\nourselves the water as plunging down at a point some yards, perhaps the\r\nwidth of the border, short of the true limit of the circle; and this is\r\na touch of local truth, since waterfalls in time always wear out a\r\nfunnel for themselves by eating back the precipice down which they\r\ntumble. It was into this funnel that Virgil flung the cord, and up it\r\nthat Geryon was seen to ascend, as if by following up the course of the\r\nwater he would find out who had made the signal. To keep to the narrow\r\ncauseway where it ran on by the edge of this gulf would seem too full of\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\n[505] _Woful folk_: Usurers; those guilty of the unnatural sin of\r\ncontemning the legitimate modes of human industry. They sit huddled up\r\non the sand, close to its bound of solid masonry, from which Dante looks\r\ndown on them. But that the usurers are not found only at the edge of the\r\nplain is evident from _Inf._ xiv. 19.\r\n\r\n[506] _Could recognise, etc._: Though most of the group prove to be from\r\nFlorence Dante recognises none of them; and this denotes that nothing so\r\nsurely creates a second nature in a man, in a bad sense, as setting the\r\nheart on money. So in the Fourth Circle those who, being unable to spend\r\nmoderately, are always thinking of how to keep or get money are\r\nrepresented as \'obscured from any recognition\' (_Inf._ vii. 44).\r\n\r\n[507] _A pregnant sow_: The azure lion on a golden field was the arms of\r\nthe Gianfigliazzi, eminent usurers of Florence; the white goose on a red\r\nground was the arms of the Ubriachi of Florence; the azure sow, of the\r\nScrovegni of Padua.\r\n\r\n[508] _Vitalian_: A rich Paduan noble, whose palace was near that of the\r\nScrovegni.\r\n\r\n[509] _Pink of Chivalry_: \'Sovereign Cavalier;\' identified by his arms\r\nas Ser Giovanni Buiamonte, still alive in Florence in 1301, and if we\r\nare to judge from the text, the greatest usurer of all. A northern poet\r\nof the time would have sought his usurers in the Jewry of some town he\r\nknew, but Dante finds his among the nobles of Padua and Florence. He\r\nironically represents them as wearing purses ornamented with their coats\r\nof arms, perhaps to hint that they pursued their dishonourable trade\r\nunder shelter of their noble names--their shop signs, as it were. The\r\nwhole passage may have been planned by Dante so as to afford him the\r\nopportunity of damning the still living Buiamonte without mentioning his\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[510] _His tongue thrust out_: As if to say: We know well what sort of\r\nfine gentleman Buiamonte is.\r\n\r\n[511] _By stairs like this_: The descent from one circle to another\r\ngrows more difficult the further down they come. They appear to have\r\nfound no special obstacle in the nature of the ground till they reached\r\nthe bank sloping down to the Fifth Circle, the pathway down which is\r\ndescribed as terrible (_Inf._ vii. 105). The descent into the Seventh\r\nCircle is made practicable, and nothing more (_Inf._ xii. I).\r\n\r\n[512] _Heaven was fired_: As still appears in the Milky Way. In the\r\n_Convito_, ii. 15, Dante discusses the various explanations of what\r\ncauses the brightness of that part of the heavens.\r\n\r\n[513] _A terrific roar_: Of the water falling to the ground. On\r\nbeginning the descent they had left the waterfall on the left hand, but\r\nGeryon, after fetching one or more great circles, passes in front of it,\r\nand then they have it on the right. There is no further mention of the\r\nwaters of Phlegethon till they are found frozen in Cocytus (_Inf._\r\nxxxii. 23). Philalethes suggests that they flow under the Eighth Circle.\r\n\r\n[514] _Lure_: An imitation bird used in training falcons. Dante\r\ndescribes the sulky, slow descent of a falcon which has either lost\r\nsight of its prey, or has failed to discover where the falconer has\r\nthrown the lure. Geryon has descended thus deliberately owing to the\r\ncommand of Virgil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Of iron colour, and composed of stone,\r\n    A place called Malebolge[515] is in Hell,\r\n    Girt by a cliff of substance like its own.\r\n  In that malignant region yawns a well[516]\r\n    Right in the centre, ample and profound;\r\n    Of which I duly will the structure tell.\r\n  The zone[517] that lies between them, then, is round--\r\n    Between the well and precipice hard and high;\r\n    Into ten vales divided is the ground.\r\n  As is the figure offered to the eye,                              10\r\n    Where numerous moats a castle\'s towers enclose\r\n    That they the walls may better fortify;\r\n  A like appearance was made here by those.\r\n    And as, again, from threshold of such place\r\n    Many a drawbridge to the outworks goes;\r\n  So ridges from the precipice\'s base\r\n    Cutting athwart the moats and barriers run,\r\n    Till at the well join the extremities.[518]\r\n  From Geryon\'s back when we were shaken down\r\n    \'Twas here we stood, until the Poet\'s feet                      20\r\n    Moved to the left, and I, behind, came on.\r\n  New torments on the right mine eyes did meet\r\n    With new tormentors, novel woe on woe;\r\n    With which the nearer Bolgia was replete.\r\n  Sinners, all naked, in the gulf below,\r\n    This side the middle met us; while they strode\r\n    On that side with us, but more swift did go.[519]\r\n  Even so the Romans, that the mighty crowd\r\n    Across the bridge, the year of Jubilee,\r\n    Might pass with ease, ordained a rule of road[520]--            30\r\n  Facing the Castle, on that side should be\r\n    The multitude which to St. Peter\'s hied;\r\n    So to the Mount on this was passage free.\r\n  On the grim rocky ground, on either side,\r\n    I saw horned devils[521] armed with heavy whip\r\n    Which on the sinners from behind they plied.\r\n  Ah, how they made the wretches nimbly skip\r\n    At the first lashes; no one ever yet\r\n    But sought from the second and the third to slip.\r\n  And as I onward went, mine eyes were set                          40\r\n    On one of them; whereon I called in haste:\r\n    \'This one already I have surely met!\'\r\n  Therefore to know him, fixedly I gazed;\r\n    And my kind Leader willingly delayed,\r\n    While for a little I my course retraced.\r\n  On this the scourged one, thinking to evade\r\n    My search, his visage bent without avail,\r\n    For: \'Thou that gazest on the ground,\' I said,\r\n  \'If these thy features tell trustworthy tale,\r\n    Venedico Caccianimico[522] thou!                                50\r\n    But what has brought thee to such sharp regale?\'[523]\r\n  And he, \'I tell it \'gainst my will, I trow,\r\n    But thy clear accents[524] to the old world bear\r\n    My memory, and make me all avow.\r\n  I was the man who Ghisola the fair\r\n    To serve the Marquis\' evil will led on,\r\n    Whatever[525] the uncomely tale declare.\r\n  Of Bolognese here weeping not alone\r\n    Am I; so full the place of them, to-day\r\n    \'Tween Reno and Savena[526] are not known                       60\r\n  So many tongues that _Sipa_ deftly say:\r\n    And if of this thou\'dst know the reason why,\r\n    Think but how greedy were our hearts alway.\'\r\n  To him thus speaking did a demon cry:\r\n    \'Pander, begone!\' and smote him with his thong;\r\n    \'Here are no women for thy coin to buy.\'\r\n  Then, with my Escort joined, I moved along.\r\n    Few steps we made until we there had come,\r\n    Where from the bank a rib of rock was flung.\r\n  With ease enough up to its top we clomb,                          70\r\n    And, turning on the ridge, bore to the right;[527]\r\n    And those eternal circles[528] parted from.\r\n  When we had reached where underneath the height\r\n    A passage opes, yielding the scourged a way,\r\n    My Guide bade: \'Tarry, so to hold in sight\r\n  Those other spirits born in evil day,\r\n    Whose faces until now from thee have been\r\n    Concealed, because with ours their progress lay.\'\r\n  Then from the ancient bridge by us were seen\r\n    The troop which toward us on that circuit sped,                 80\r\n    Chased onward, likewise, by the scourges keen.\r\n  And my good Master, ere I asked him, said:\r\n    \'That lordly one now coming hither, see,\r\n    By whom, despite of pain, no tears are shed.\r\n  What mien he still retains of majesty!\r\n    \'Tis Jason, who by courage and by guile\r\n    The Colchians of the ram deprived. \'Twas he\r\n  Who on his passage by the Lemnian isle,\r\n    Where all of womankind with daring hand\r\n    Upon their males had wrought a murder vile,                     90\r\n  With loving pledges and with speeches bland\r\n    The tender-yeared Hypsipyle betrayed,\r\n    Who had herself a fraud on others planned.\r\n  Forlorn he left her then, when pregnant made.\r\n    That is the crime condemns him to this pain;\r\n    And for Medea[529] too is vengeance paid.\r\n  Who in his manner cheat compose his train.\r\n    Of the first moat sufficient now is known,\r\n    And those who in its jaws engulfed remain.\'\r\n  Already had we by the strait path gone                           100\r\n    To where \'tis with the second bank dovetailed--\r\n    The buttress whence a second arch is thrown.\r\n  Here heard we who in the next Bolgia wailed[530]\r\n    And puffed for breath; reverberations told\r\n    They with their open palms themselves assailed.\r\n  The sides were crusted over with a mould\r\n    Plastered upon them by foul mists that rise,\r\n    And both with eyes and nose a contest hold.\r\n  The bottom is so deep, in vain our eyes\r\n    Searched it till further up the bridge we went,                110\r\n    To where the arch o\'erhangs what under lies.\r\n  Ascended there, our eyes we downward bent,\r\n    And I saw people in such ordure drowned,\r\n    A very cesspool \'twas of excrement.\r\n  And while I from above am searching round,\r\n    One with a head so filth-smeared I picked out,\r\n    I knew not if \'twas lay, or tonsure-crowned.\r\n  \'Why then so eager,\' asked he with a shout,\r\n    \'To stare at me of all the filthy crew?\'\r\n    And I to him: \'Because I scarce can doubt                      120\r\n  That formerly thee dry of hair I knew,\r\n    Alessio Interminei[531] the Lucchese;\r\n    And therefore thee I chiefly hold in view.\'\r\n  Smiting his head-piece, then, his words were these:\r\n    \'\'Twas flattery steeped me here; for, using such,\r\n    My tongue itself enough could never please.\'\r\n  \'Now stretch thou somewhat forward, but not much,\'\r\n    Thereon my Leader bade me, \'and thine eyes\r\n    Slowly advance till they her features touch\r\n  And the dishevelled baggage recognise,                           130\r\n    Clawing her yonder with her nails unclean,\r\n    Now standing up, now squatting on her thighs.\r\n  \'Tis harlot Thais,[532] who, when she had been\r\n    Asked by her lover, "Am I generous\r\n    And worthy thanks?" said, "Greatly so, I ween."\r\n  Enough[533] of this place has been seen by us.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[515] _Malebolge_: Or Evil Pits; literally, Evil Pockets.\r\n\r\n[516] _A well_: The Ninth and lowest Circle, to be described in Canto\r\nxxxii., etc.\r\n\r\n[517] _The zone_: The Eighth Circle, in which the fraudulent of all\r\nspecies are punished, lies between the precipice and the Ninth Circle. A\r\nvivid picture of the enormous height of the enclosing wall has been\r\npresented to us at the close of the preceding Canto. As in the\r\ndescription of the Second Circle the atmosphere is represented as\r\nmalignant, being murky and disturbed with tempest; so the Malebolge is\r\ncalled malignant too, being all of barren iron-coloured rock. In both\r\ncases the surroundings of the sinners may well be spoken of as malign,\r\nadverse to any thought of goodwill and joy.\r\n\r\n[518] _The extremities_: The _Malebolge_ consists of ten circular pits\r\nor fosses, one inside of another. The outermost lies under the precipice\r\nwhich falls sheer from the Seventh Circle; the innermost, and of course\r\nthe smallest, runs immediately outside of the \'Well,\' which is the Ninth\r\nCircle. The Bolgias or valleys are divided from each other by rocky\r\nbanks; and, each Bolgia being at a lower level than the one that\r\nencloses it, the inside of each bank is necessarily deeper than the\r\noutside. Ribs or ridges of rock--like spokes of a wheel to the\r\naxle-tree--run from the foot of the precipice to the outer rim of the\r\n\'Well,\' vaulting the moats at right angles with the course of them. Thus\r\neach rib takes the form of a ten-arched bridge. By one or other of these\r\nVirgil and Dante now travel towards the centre and the base of Inferno;\r\ntheir general course being downward, though varied by the ascent in turn\r\nof the hog-backed arches over the moats.\r\n\r\n[519] _More swift_: The sinners in the First Bolgia are divided into two\r\ngangs, moving in opposite directions, the course of those on the outside\r\nbeing to the right, as looked at by Dante. These are the shades of\r\npanders; those in the inner current are such as seduced on their own\r\naccount. Here a list of the various classes of sinners contained in the\r\nBolgias of the Eighth Circle may be given:--\r\n\r\n  1st  Bolgia--Seducers,                   CANTO XVIII.\r\n  2d     "     Flatterers,                   "     "\r\n  3d     "     Simoniacs,                    "   XIX.\r\n  4th    "     Soothsayers,                  "   XX.\r\n  5th    "     Barrators,                    "   XXI. XXII.\r\n  6th    "     Hypocrites,                   "   XXIII.\r\n  7th    "     Thieves,                      "   XXIV. XXV.\r\n  8th    "     Evil Counsellors,             "   XXVI. XXVII.\r\n  9th    "     Scandal and Heresy Mongers,   "   XXVIII. XXIX.\r\n  10th   "     Falsifiers,                   "   XXIX. XXX.\r\n\r\n[520] _A rule of road_: In the year 1300 a Jubilee was held in Rome with\r\nPlenary Indulgence for all pilgrims. Villani says that while it lasted\r\nthe number of strangers in Rome was never less than two hundred\r\nthousand. The bridge and castle spoken of in the text are those of St.\r\nAngelo. The Mount is probably the Janiculum.\r\n\r\n[521] _Horned devils_: Here the demons are horned--terrible\r\nremembrancers to the sinner of the injured husband.\r\n\r\n[522] _Venedico Caccianimico_: A Bolognese noble, brother of Ghisola,\r\nwhom he inveigled into yielding herself to the Marquis of Este, lord of\r\nFerrara. Venedico died between 1290 and 1300.\r\n\r\n[523] _Such sharp regale_: \'Such pungent sauces.\' There is here a play\r\nof words on the _Salse_, the name of a wild ravine outside the walls of\r\nBologna, where the bodies of felons were thrown. Benvenuto says it used\r\nto be a taunt among boys at Bologna: Your father was pitched into the\r\nSalse.\r\n\r\n[524] _Thy clear accents_: Not broken with sobs like his own and those\r\nof his companions.\r\n\r\n[525] _Whatever, etc._: Different accounts seem to have been current\r\nabout the affair of Ghisola.\r\n\r\n[526] _\'Tween Reno, etc._: The Reno and Savena are streams that flow\r\npast Bologna. _Sipa_ is Bolognese for Maybe, or for Yes. So Dante\r\ndescribes Tuscany as the country where _Si_ is heard (_Inf._ xxxiii.\r\n80). With regard to the vices of the Bolognese, Benvenuto says: \'Dante\r\nhad studied in Bologna, and had seen and observed all these things.\'\r\n\r\n[527] _To the right_: This is only an apparent departure from their\r\nleftward course. Moving as they were to the left along the edge of the\r\nBolgia, they required to turn to the right to cross the bridge that\r\nspanned it.\r\n\r\n[528] _Those eternal circles_: The meaning is not clear; perhaps it only\r\nis that they have now done with the outer stream of sinners in this\r\nBolgia, left by them engaged in endless procession round and round.\r\n\r\n[529] _Medea_: When the Argonauts landed on Lemnos, they found it\r\nwithout any males, the women, incited by Venus, having put them all to\r\ndeath, with the exception of Thoas, saved by his daughter Hypsipyle.\r\nWhen Jason deserted her he sailed for Colchis, and with the assistance\r\nof Medea won the Golden Fleece. Medea, who accompanied him from Colchis,\r\nwas in turn deserted by him.\r\n\r\n[530] _Who in the next Bolgia wailed_: The flatterers in the Second\r\nBolgia.\r\n\r\n[531] _Alessio Interminei_: Of the Great Lucchese family of the\r\nInterminelli, to which the famous Castruccio Castrucani belonged.\r\nAlessio is know to have been living in 1295. Dante may have known him\r\npersonally. Benvenuto says he was so liberal of his flattery that he\r\nspent it even on menial servants.\r\n\r\n[532] _Thais_: In the _Eunuch_ of Terence, Thraso, the lover of that\r\ncourtesan, asks Gnatho, their go-between, if she really sent him many\r\nthanks for the present of a slave-girl he had sent her. \'Enormous!\' says\r\nGnatho. It proves what great store Dante set on ancient instances when\r\nhe thought this worth citing.\r\n\r\n[533] _Enough, etc._: Most readers will agree with Virgil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  O Simon Magus![534] ye his wretched crew!\r\n    The gifts of God, ordained to be the bride\r\n    Of righteousness, ye prostitute that you\r\n  With gold and silver may be satisfied;\r\n    Therefore for you let now the trumpet[535] blow,\r\n    Seeing that ye in the Third Bolgia \'bide.\r\n  Arrived at the next tomb,[536] we to the brow\r\n    Of rock ere this had finished our ascent,\r\n    Which hangs true plumb above the pit below.\r\n  What perfect art, O Thou Omniscient,                              10\r\n    Is Thine in Heaven and earth and the bad world found!\r\n    How justly does Thy power its dooms invent!\r\n  The livid stone, on both banks and the ground,\r\n    I saw was full of holes on every side,\r\n    All of one size, and each of them was round.\r\n  No larger seemed they to me nor less wide\r\n    Than those within my beautiful St. John[537]\r\n    For the baptizers\' standing-place supplied;\r\n  And one of which, not many years agone,\r\n    I broke to save one drowning; and I would                       20\r\n    Have this for seal to undeceive men known.\r\n  Out of the mouth of each were seen protrude\r\n    A sinner\'s feet, and of the legs the small\r\n    Far as the calves; the rest enveloped stood.\r\n  And set on fire were both the soles of all,\r\n    Which made their ankles wriggle with such throes\r\n    As had made ropes and withes asunder fall.\r\n  And as flame fed by unctuous matter goes\r\n    Over the outer surface only spread;\r\n    So from their heels it flickered to the toes.                   30\r\n  \'Master, who is he, tortured more,\' I said,\r\n    \'Than are his neighbours, writhing in such woe;\r\n    And licked by flames of deeper-hearted red?\'\r\n  And he: \'If thou desirest that below\r\n    I bear thee by that bank[538] which lowest lies,\r\n    Thou from himself his sins and name shalt know.\'\r\n  And I: \'Thy wishes still for me suffice:\r\n    Thou art my Lord, and knowest I obey\r\n    Thy will; and dost my hidden thoughts surprise.\'\r\n  To the fourth barrier then we made our way,                       40\r\n    And, to the left hand turning, downward went\r\n    Into the narrow hole-pierced cavity;\r\n  Nor the good Master caused me make descent\r\n    From off his haunch till we his hole were nigh\r\n    Who with his shanks was making such lament.\r\n  \'Whoe\'er thou art, soul full of misery,\r\n    Set like a stake with lower end upcast,\'\r\n    I said to him, \'Make, if thou canst, reply.\'\r\n  I like a friar[539] stood who gives the last\r\n    Shrift to a vile assassin, to his side                          50\r\n    Called back to win delay for him fixed fast.\r\n  \'Art thou arrived already?\' then he cried,\r\n    \'Art thou arrived already, Boniface?\r\n    By several years the prophecy[540] has lied.\r\n  Art so soon wearied of the wealthy place,\r\n    For which thou didst not fear to take with guile,\r\n    Then ruin the fair Lady?\'[541] Now my case\r\n  Was like to theirs who linger on, the while\r\n    They cannot comprehend what they are told,\r\n    And as befooled[542] from further speech resile.                60\r\n  But Virgil bade me: \'Speak out loud and bold,\r\n    "I am not he thou thinkest, no, not he!"\'\r\n    And I made answer as by him controlled.\r\n  The spirit\'s feet then twisted violently,\r\n    And, sighing in a voice of deep distress,\r\n    He asked: \'What then requirest thou of me?\r\n  If me to know thou hast such eagerness,\r\n    That thou the cliff hast therefore ventured down,\r\n    Know, the Great Mantle sometime was my dress.\r\n  I of the Bear, in sooth, was worthy son:                          70\r\n    As once, the Cubs to help, my purse with gain\r\n    I stuffed, myself I in this purse have stown.\r\n  Stretched out at length beneath my head remain\r\n    All the simoniacs[543] that before me went,\r\n    And flattened lie throughout the rocky vein.\r\n  I in my turn shall also make descent,\r\n    Soon as he comes who I believed thou wast,\r\n    When I asked quickly what for him was meant.\r\n  O\'er me with blazing feet more time has past,\r\n    While upside down I fill the topmost room,                      80\r\n    Than he his crimsoned feet shall upward cast;\r\n  For after him one viler still shall come,\r\n    A Pastor from the West,[544] lawless of deed:\r\n    To cover both of us his worthy doom.\r\n  A modern Jason[545] he, of whom we read\r\n    In Maccabees, whose King denied him nought:\r\n    With the French King so shall this man succeed.\'\r\n  Perchance I ventured further than I ought,\r\n    But I spake to him in this measure free:\r\n    \'Ah, tell me now what money was there sought                    90\r\n  Of Peter by our Lord, when either key\r\n    He gave him in his guardianship to hold?\r\n    Sure He demanded nought save: "Follow me!"\r\n  Nor Peter, nor the others, asked for gold\r\n    Or silver when upon Matthias fell\r\n    The lot instead of him, the traitor-souled.\r\n  Keep then thy place, for thou art punished well,[546]\r\n    And clutch the pelf, dishonourably gained,\r\n    Which against Charles[547] made thee so proudly swell.\r\n  And, were it not that I am still restrained                      100\r\n    By reverence[548] for those tremendous keys,\r\n    Borne by thee while the glad world thee contained,\r\n  I would use words even heavier than these;\r\n    Seeing your avarice makes the world deplore,\r\n    Crushing the good, filling the bad with ease.\r\n  \'Twas you, O Pastors, the Evangelist bore\r\n    In mind what time he saw her on the flood\r\n    Of waters set, who played with kings the whore;\r\n  Who with seven heads was born; and as she would\r\n    By the ten horns to her was service done,                      110\r\n    Long as her spouse[549] rejoiced in what was good.\r\n  Now gold and silver are your god alone:\r\n    What difference \'twixt the idolater and you,\r\n    Save that ye pray a hundred for his one?\r\n  Ah, Constantine,[550] how many evils grew--\r\n    Not from thy change of faith, but from the gift\r\n    Wherewith thou didst the first rich Pope endue!\'\r\n  While I my voice continued to uplift\r\n    To such a tune, by rage or conscience stirred\r\n    Both of his soles he made to twist and shift.                  120\r\n  My Guide, I well believe, with pleasure heard;\r\n    Listening he stood with lips so well content\r\n    To me propounding truthful word on word.\r\n  Then round my body both his arms he bent,\r\n    And, having raised me well upon his breast,\r\n    Climbed up the path by which he made descent.\r\n  Nor was he by his burden so oppressed\r\n    But that he bore me to the bridge\'s crown,\r\n    Which with the fourth joins the fifth rampart\'s crest.\r\n  And lightly here he set his burden down,                         130\r\n    Found light by him upon the precipice,\r\n    Up which a goat uneasily had gone.\r\n  And thence another valley met mine eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[534] _Simon Magus_: The sin of simony consists in setting a price on\r\nthe exercise of a spiritual grace or the acquisition of a spiritual\r\noffice. Dante assails it at headquarters, that is, as it was practised\r\nby the Popes; and in their case it took, among other forms, that of\r\necclesiastical nepotism.\r\n\r\n[535] _The trumpet_: Blown at the punishment of criminals, to call\r\nattention to their sentence.\r\n\r\n[536] _The next tomb_: The Third Bolgia, appropriately termed a tomb,\r\nbecause its manner of punishment is that of a burial, as will be seen.\r\n\r\n[537] _St. John_: The church of St. John\'s, in Dante\'s time, as now, the\r\nBaptistery of Florence. In _Parad._ xxv. he anticipates the day, if it\r\nshould ever come, when he shall return to Florence, and in the church\r\nwhere he was baptized a Christian be crowned as a Poet. Down to the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century all baptisms, except in cases of urgent\r\nnecessity, were celebrated in St. John\'s; and, even there, only on the\r\neves of Easter and Pentecost. For protection against the crowd, the\r\nofficiating priests were provided with standing-places, circular\r\ncavities disposed around the great font. To these Dante compares the\r\nholes of this Bolgia, for the sake of introducing a defence of himself\r\nfrom a charge of sacrilege. Benvenuto tells that once when some boys\r\nwere playing about the church one of them, to hide himself from his\r\ncompanions, squeezed himself into a baptizer\'s standing-place, and made\r\nso tight a fit of it that he could not be rescued till Dante with his\r\nown hands plied a hammer upon the marble, and so saved the child from\r\ndrowning. The presence of water in the cavity may be explained by the\r\nfact of the church\'s being at that time lighted by an unglazed opening\r\nin the roof; and as baptisms were so infrequent the standing-places,\r\nsituated as they were in the centre of the floor, may often have been\r\npartially flooded. It is easy to understand how bitterly Dante would\r\nresent a charge of irreverence connected with his \'beautiful St.\r\nJohn\'s;\' \'that fair sheep-fold\' (_Parad._ xxv. 5).\r\n\r\n[538] _That bank, etc._: Of each Bolgia the inner bank is lower than the\r\nouter; the whole of Malebolge sloping towards the centre of the Inferno.\r\n\r\n[539] _Like a friar, etc._: In those times the punishment of an assassin\r\nwas to be stuck head downward in a pit, and then to have earth slowly\r\nshovelled in till he was suffocated. Dante bends down, the better to\r\nhear what the sinner has to say, like a friar recalled by the felon on\r\nthe pretence that he has something to add to his confession.\r\n\r\n[540] _The prophecy_: \'The writing.\' The speaker is Nicholas III., of\r\nthe great Roman family of the Orsini, and Pope from 1277 to 1280; a man\r\nof remarkable bodily beauty and grace of manner, as well as of great\r\nforce of character. Like many other Holy Fathers he was either a great\r\nhypocrite while on his promotion, or else he degenerated very quickly\r\nafter getting himself well settled on the Papal Chair. He is said to\r\nhave been the first Pope who practised simony with no attempt at\r\nconcealment. Boniface VIII., whom he is waiting for to relieve him,\r\nbecame Pope in 1294, and died in 1303. None of the four Popes between\r\n1280 and 1294 were simoniacs; so that Nicholas was uppermost in the hole\r\nfor twenty-three years. Although ignorant of what is now passing on the\r\nearth, he can refer back to his foreknowledge of some years earlier (see\r\n_Inf._ x. 99) as if to a prophetic writing, and finds that according to\r\nthis it is still three years too soon, it being now only 1300, for the\r\narrival of Boniface. This is the usual explanation of the passage. To it\r\nlies the objection that foreknowledge of the present that can be\r\nreferred back to is the same thing as knowledge of it, and with this the\r\nspirits in Inferno are not endowed. But Dante elsewhere shows that he\r\nfinds it hard to observe the limitation. The alternative explanation,\r\nsupported by the use of _scritto_ (writing) in the text, is that\r\nNicholas refers to some prophecy once current about his successors in\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n[541] _The fair Lady_: The Church. The guile is that shown by Boniface\r\nin getting his predecessor Celestine v. to abdicate (_Inf._ iii. 60).\r\n\r\n[542] _As befooled_: Dante does not yet suspect that it is with a Pope\r\nhe is speaking. He is dumbfounded at being addressed as Boniface.\r\n\r\n[543] _All the simoniacs_: All the Popes that had been guilty of the\r\nsin.\r\n\r\n[544] _A Pastor from the West_: Boniface died in 1303, and was succeeded\r\nby Benedict XI., who in his turn was succeeded by Clement V., the Pastor\r\nfrom the West. Benedict was not stained with simony, and so it is\r\nClement that is to relieve Boniface; and he is to come from the West,\r\nthat is, from Avignon, to which the Holy See was removed by him. Or the\r\nreference may simply be to the country of his birth. Elsewhere he is\r\nspoken of as \'the Gascon who shall cheat the noble Henry\' of Luxemburg\r\n(_Parad._ xvii. 82).--This passage has been read as throwing light on\r\nthe question of when the _Inferno_ was written. Nicholas says that from\r\nthe time Boniface arrives till Clement relieves him will be a shorter\r\nperiod than that during which he has himself been in Inferno, that is to\r\nsay, a shorter time than twenty years. Clement died in 1314; and so, it\r\nis held, we find a date before which the _Inferno_ was, at least, not\r\npublished. But Clement was known for years before his death to be ill of\r\na disease usually soon fatal. He became Pope in 1305, and the wonder was\r\nthat he survived so long as nine years. Dante keeps his prophecy\r\nsafe--if it is a prophecy; and there does seem internal evidence to\r\nprove the publication of the _Inferno_ to have taken place long before\r\n1314.--It is needless to point out how the censure of Clement gains in\r\nforce if read as having been published before his death.\r\n\r\n[545] _Jason_: Or Joshua, who purchased the office of High Priest from\r\nAntiochus Epiphanes, and innovated the customs of the Jews (2 Maccab.\r\niv. 7).\r\n\r\n[546] _Punished well_: At line 12 Dante has admired the propriety of the\r\nDivine distribution of penalties. He appears to regard with a special\r\ncomplacency that which he invents for the simoniacs. They were\r\nindustrious in multiplying benefices for their kindred; Boniface, for\r\nexample, besides Cardinals, appointed about twenty Archbishops and\r\nBishops from among his own relatives. Here all the simoniacal Popes have\r\nto be contented with one place among them. They paid no regard to\r\nwhether a post was well filled or not: here they are set upside down.\r\n\r\n[547] _Charles_: Nicholas was accused of taking a bribe to assist Peter\r\nof Arragon in ousting Charles of Anjou from the kingdom of Sicily.\r\n\r\n[548] _By reverence, etc._: Dante distinguishes between the office and\r\nthe unworthy holder of it. So in Purgatory he prostrates himself before\r\na Pope (_Purg._ xix. 131).\r\n\r\n[549] _Her spouse_: In the preceding lines the vision of the Woman in\r\nthe Apocalypse is applied to the corruption of the Church, represented\r\nunder the figure of the seven-hilled Rome seated in honour among the\r\nnations and receiving observance from the kings of the earth till her\r\nspouse, the Pope, began to prostitute her by making merchandise of her\r\nspiritual gifts. Of the Beast there is no mention here, his qualities\r\nbeing attributed to the Woman.\r\n\r\n[550] _Ah, Constantine, etc._: In Dante\'s time, and for some centuries\r\nlater, it was believed that Constantine, on transferring the seat of\r\nempire to Byzantium, had made a gift to the Pope of rights and\r\nprivileges almost equal to those of the Emperor. Rome was to be the\r\nPope\'s; and from his court in the Lateran he was to exercise supremacy\r\nover all the West. The Donation of Constantine, that is, the instrument\r\nconveying these rights, was a forgery of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now of new torment must my verses tell,\r\n    And matter for the Twentieth Canto win\r\n    Of Lay the First,[551] which treats of souls in Hell.\r\n  Already was I eager to begin\r\n    To peer into the visible profound,[552]\r\n    Which tears of agony was bath\xc3\xa8d in:\r\n  And I saw people in the valley round;\r\n    Like that of penitents on earth the pace\r\n    At which they weeping came, nor uttering[553] sound.\r\n  When I beheld them with more downcast gaze,[554]                  10\r\n    That each was strangely screwed about I learned,\r\n    Where chest is joined to chin. And thus the face\r\n  Of every one round to his loins was turned;\r\n    And stepping backward[555] all were forced to go,\r\n    For nought in front could be by them discerned.\r\n  Smitten by palsy although one might show\r\n    Perhaps a shape thus twisted all awry,\r\n    I never saw, and am to think it slow.\r\n  As, Reader,[556] God may grant thou profit by\r\n    Thy reading, for thyself consider well                          20\r\n    If I could then preserve my visage dry\r\n  When close at hand to me was visible\r\n    Our human form so wrenched that tears, rained down\r\n    Out of the eyes, between the buttocks fell.\r\n  In very sooth I wept, leaning upon\r\n    A boss of the hard cliff, till on this wise\r\n    My Escort asked: \'Of the other fools[557] art one?\r\n  Here piety revives as pity dies;\r\n    For who more irreligious is than he\r\n    In whom God\'s judgments to regret give rise?                    30\r\n  Lift up, lift up thy head, and thou shalt see\r\n    Him for whom earth yawned as the Thebans saw,\r\n    All shouting meanwhile: "Whither dost thou flee,\r\n  Amphiara\xc3\xbcs?[558] Wherefore thus withdraw\r\n    From battle?" But he sinking found no rest\r\n    Till Minos clutched him with all-grasping claw.\r\n  Lo, how his shoulders serve him for a breast!\r\n    Because he wished to see too far before\r\n    Backward he looks, to backward course addressed.\r\n  Behold Tiresias,[559] who was changed all o\'er,                   40\r\n    Till for a man a woman met the sight,\r\n    And not a limb its former semblance bore;\r\n  And he behoved a second time to smite\r\n    The same two twisted serpents with his wand,\r\n    Ere he again in manly plumes was dight.\r\n  With back to him, see Aruns next at hand,\r\n    Who up among the hills of Luni, where\r\n    Peasants of near Carrara till the land,\r\n  Among the dazzling marbles[560] held his lair\r\n    Within a cavern, whence could be descried                       50\r\n    The sea and stars of all obstruction bare.\r\n  The other one, whose flowing tresses hide\r\n    Her bosom, of the which thou seest nought,\r\n    And all whose hair falls on the further side,\r\n  Was Manto;[561] who through many regions sought:\r\n    Where I was born, at last her foot she stayed.\r\n    It likes me well thou shouldst of this be taught.\r\n  When from this life her father exit made,\r\n    And Bacchus\' city had become enthralled,\r\n    She for long time through many countries strayed.               60\r\n  \'Neath mountains by which Germany is walled\r\n    And bounded at Tirol, a lake there lies\r\n    High in fair Italy, Benacus[562] called.\r\n  The waters of a thousand springs that rise\r\n    \'Twixt Val Camonica and Garda flow\r\n    Down Pennine;

Their sin is that of seeking to find out what\r\nGod has made secret. That such discoveries of the future could be made\r\nby men, Dante seems to have had no doubt; but he regards the exercise of\r\nthe power as a fraud on Providence, and also credits the adepts in the\r\nblack art with ruining others by their spells (line 123).\r\n\r\n[553] _Nor uttering, etc._: They who on earth told too much are now\r\ncondemned to be for ever dumb.

It is still a\r\ngreat fortress.\r\n\r\n[565] _Without casting lot_; Without consulting the omens, as was usual\r\nwhen a city was to be named.\r\n\r\n[566] _Casalodi_: Some time in the second half of the thirteenth century\r\nAlberto Casalodi was befooled out of the lordship of Mantua by Pinamonte\r\nBuonacolsi. Benvenuto tells the tale as follows:--Pinamonte was a bold,\r\nambitious man, with a great troop of armed followers; and, the nobility\r\nbeing at that time in bad odour with the people at large, he persuaded\r\nthe Count Albert that it would be a popular measure to banish the\r\nsuspected nobles for a time. Hardly was this done when he usurped the\r\nlordship; and by expelling some of the citizens and putting others of\r\nthem to death he greatly thinned the population of the city.\r\n\r\n[567] _All my thoughts, etc._: The reader\'s patience is certainly abused\r\nby this digression of Virgil\'s, and Dante himself seems conscious that\r\nit is somewhat ill-timed.\r\n\r\n[568] _The land of Greece, etc._: All the Greeks able to bear arms being\r\nengaged in the Trojan expedition.\r\n\r\n[569] _An augur_: Eurypylus, mentioned in the Second _\xc3\x86neid_ as being\r\nemployed by the Greeks to consult the oracle of Apollo regarding their\r\nreturn to Greece. From the auspices Calchas had found at what hour they\r\nshould set sail for Troy. Eurypylus can be said only figuratively to\r\nhave had to do with cutting the cable.\r\n\r\n[570] _Tragedy_: The _\xc3\x86neid_. Dante defines Comedy as being written in a\r\nstyle inferior to that of Tragedy, and as having a sad beginning and a\r\nhappy ending (Epistle to Can Grande, 10). Elsewhere he allows the comic\r\npoet great licence in the use of common language (_Vulg. El._ ii. 4). By\r\ncalling his own poem a Comedy he, as it were, disarms criticism.\r\n\r\n[571] _Michael Scott_: Of Balwearie in Scotland, familiar to English\r\nreaders through the _Lay of the Last Minstrel_. He flourished in the\r\ncourse of the thirteenth century, and made contributions to the\r\nsciences, as they were then deemed, of astrology, alchemy, and\r\nphysiognomy. He acted for some time as astrologer to the Emperor\r\nFrederick II., and the tradition of his accomplishments powerfully\r\naffected the Italian imagination for a century after his death. It was\r\nremembered that the terrible Frederick, after being warned by him to\r\nbeware of Florence, had died at a place called Firenzuola; and more than\r\none Italian city preserved with fear and trembling his dark sayings\r\nregarding their fate. Villani frequently quotes his prophecies; and\r\nBoccaccio speaks of him as a great necromancer who had been in Florence.\r\nA commentary of his on Aristotle was printed at Venice in 1496. The\r\nthinness of his flanks may refer to a belief that he could make himself\r\ninvisible at will.\r\n\r\n[572] _Guido Bonatti_: Was a Florentine, a tiler by trade, and was\r\nliving in 1282. When banished from his own city he took refuge at Forl\xc3\xac\r\nand became astrologer to Guido of Montefeltro (_Inf._ xxvii.), and was\r\ncredited with helping his master to a great victory.--_Asdente_: A\r\ncobbler of Parma, whose prophecies were long renowned, lived in the\r\ntwelfth century. He is given in the _Convito_ (iv. 16) as an instance\r\nthat a man may be very notorious without being truly noble.\r\n\r\n[573] _Herb and image_: Part of the witch\'s stock in trade. All that was\r\ndone to a waxen image of him was suffered by the witch\'s victim.\r\n\r\n[574] _Cain and the Thorns_: The moon. The belief that the spots in the\r\nmoon are caused by Cain standing in it with a bundle of thorns is\r\nreferred to at _Parad._ ii. 51. Although it is now the morning of the\r\nSaturday, the \'yesternight\' refers to the night of Thursday, when Dante\r\nfound some use of the moon in the Forest. The moon is now setting on the\r\nline dividing the hemisphere of Jerusalem, in which they are, from that\r\nof the Mount of Purgatory. According to Dante\'s scheme of the world,\r\nPurgatory is the true opposite of Jerusalem; and Seville is ninety\r\ndegrees from Jerusalem. As it was full moon the night before last, and\r\nthe moon is now setting, it is now fully an hour after sunrise. But, as\r\nhas already been said, it is not possible to reconcile the astronomical\r\nindications thoroughly with one another.--Virgil serves as clock to\r\nDante, for they can see nothing of the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Conversing still from bridge to bridge[575] we went;\r\n    But what our words I in my Comedy\r\n    Care not to tell. The top of the ascent\r\n  Holding, we halted the next pit to spy\r\n    Of Malebolge, with plaints bootless all:\r\n    There, darkness[576] full of wonder met the eye.\r\n  As the Venetians[577] in their Arsenal\r\n    Boil the tenacious pitch at winter-tide,\r\n    To caulk the ships with for repairs that call;\r\n  For then they cannot sail; and so, instead,                       10\r\n    One builds his bark afresh, one stops with tow\r\n    His vessel\'s ribs, by many a voyage tried;\r\n  One hammers at the poop, one at the prow;\r\n    Some fashion oars, and others cables twine,\r\n    And others at the jib and main sails sew:\r\n  So, not by fire, but by an art Divine,\r\n    Pitch of thick substance boiled in that low Hell,\r\n    And all the banks did as with plaster line.\r\n  I saw it, but distinguished nothing well\r\n    Except the bubbles by the boiling raised,                       20\r\n    Now swelling up and ceasing now to swell.\r\n  While down upon it fixedly I gazed,\r\n    \'Beware, beware!\' my Leader to me said,\r\n    And drew me thence close to him. I, amazed,\r\n  Turned sharply round, like him who has delayed,\r\n    Fain to behold the thing he ought to flee,\r\n    Then, losing nerve, grows suddenly afraid,\r\n  Nor lingers longer what there is to see;\r\n    For a black devil I beheld advance\r\n    Over the cliff behind us rapidly.                               30\r\n  Ah me, how fierce was he of countenance!\r\n    What bitterness he in his gesture put,\r\n    As with spread wings he o\'er the ground did dance!\r\n  Upon his shoulders, prominent and acute,\r\n    Was perched a sinner[578] fast by either hip;\r\n    And him he held by tendon of the foot.\r\n  He from our bridge: \'Ho, Malebranche![579] Grip\r\n    An Elder brought from Santa Zita\'s town:[580]\r\n    Stuff him below; myself once more I slip\r\n  Back to the place where lack of such is none.                     40\r\n    There, save Bonturo, barrates[581] every man,\r\n    And No grows Yes that money may be won.\'\r\n  He shot him down, and o\'er the cliff began\r\n    To run; nor unchained mastiff o\'er the ground,\r\n    Chasing a robber, swifter ever ran.\r\n  The other sank, then rose with back bent round;\r\n    But from beneath the bridge the devils cried:\r\n    \'Not here the Sacred Countenance[582] is found,\r\n  One swims not here as on the Serchio\'s[583] tide;\r\n    So if thou wouldst not with our grapplers deal                  50\r\n    Do not on surface of the pitch abide.\'\r\n  Then he a hundred hooks[584] was made to feel.\r\n    \'Best dance down there,\' they said the while to him,\r\n    \'Where, if thou canst, thou on the sly mayst steal.\'\r\n  So scullions by the cooks are set to trim\r\n    The caldrons and with forks the pieces steep\r\n    Down in the water, that they may not swim.\r\n  And the good Master said to me: \'Now creep\r\n    Behind a rocky splinter for a screen;\r\n    So from their knowledge thou thyself shalt keep.                60\r\n  And fear not thou although with outrage keen\r\n    I be opposed, for I am well prepared,\r\n    And formerly[585] have in like contest been.\'\r\n  Then passing from the bridge\'s crown he fared\r\n    To the sixth bank,[586] and when thereon he stood\r\n    He needed courage doing what he dared.\r\n  In the same furious and tempestuous mood\r\n    In which the dogs upon the beggar leap,\r\n    Who, halting suddenly, seeks alms or food,\r\n  They issued forth from underneath the deep                        70\r\n    Vault of the bridge, with grapplers \'gainst him stretched;\r\n    But he exclaimed: \'Aloof, and harmless keep!\r\n  Ere I by any of your hooks be touched,\r\n    Come one of you and to my words give ear;\r\n    And then advise you if I should be clutched.\'\r\n  All cried: \'Let Malacoda then go near;\'\r\n    On which one moved, the others standing still.\r\n    He coming said: \'What will this[587] help him here?\'\r\n  \'O Malacoda, is it credible\r\n    That I am come,\' my Master then replied,                        80\r\n    \'Secure your opposition to repel,\r\n  Without Heaven\'s will, and fate, upon my side?\r\n    Let me advance, for \'tis by Heaven\'s behest\r\n    That I on this rough road another guide.\'\r\n  Then was his haughty spirit so depressed,\r\n    He let his hook drop sudden to his feet,\r\n    And, \'Strike him not!\' commanded all the rest\r\n  My Leader charged me thus: \'Thou, from thy seat\r\n    Where \'mid the bridge\'s ribs thou crouchest low,\r\n    Rejoin me now in confidence complete.\'                          90\r\n  Whereon I to rejoin him was not slow;\r\n    And then the devils, crowding, came so near,\r\n    I feared they to their paction false might show.\r\n  So at Caprona[588] saw I footmen fear,\r\n    Spite of their treaty, when a multitude\r\n    Of foes received them, crowding front and rear.\r\n  With all my body braced I closer stood\r\n    To him, my Leader, and intently eyed\r\n    The aspect of them, which was far from good.\r\n  Lowering their grapplers, \'mong themselves they cried:\r\n    \'Shall I now tickle him upon the thigh?\'                       101\r\n    \'Yea, see thou clip him deftly,\' one replied.\r\n  The demon who in parley had drawn nigh\r\n    Unto my Leader, upon this turned round;\r\n    \'Scarmiglione, lay thy weapon by!\'\r\n  He said; and then to us: \'No way is found\r\n    Further along this cliff, because, undone,\r\n    All the sixth arch lies ruined on the ground.\r\n  But if it please you further to pass on,\r\n    Over this rocky ridge advancing climb                          110\r\n    To the next rib,[589] where passage may be won.\r\n  Yestreen,[590] but five hours later than this time,\r\n    Twelve hundred sixty-six years reached an end,\r\n    Since the way lost the wholeness of its prime.\r\n  Thither I some of mine will straightway send\r\n    To see that none peer forth to breathe the air:\r\n    Go on with them; you they will not offend.\r\n  You, Alichin[591] and Calcabrin, prepare\r\n    To move,\' he bade; \'Cagnazzo, thou as well;\r\n    Guiding the ten, thou, Barbariccia, fare.                      120\r\n  With Draghignazzo, Libicocco fell,\r\n    Fanged Ciriatto, Graffiacane too,\r\n    Set on, mad Rubicant and Farfarel:\r\n  Search on all quarters round the boiling glue.\r\n    Let these go safe, till at the bridge they be,\r\n    Which doth unbroken[592] o\'er the caverns go.\'\r\n  \'Alas, my Master, what is this I see?\'\r\n    Said I, \'Unguided, let us forward set,\r\n    If thou know\'st how. I wish no company.\r\n  If former caution thou dost not forget,                          130\r\n    Dost thou not mark how each his teeth doth grind,\r\n    The while toward us their brows are full of threat?\'\r\n  And he: \'I would not fear should fill thy mind;\r\n   Let them grin all they will, and all they can;\r\n    \'Tis at the wretches in the pitch confined.\'\r\n  They wheeled and down the left hand bank began\r\n    To march, but first each bit his tongue,[593] and passed\r\n    The signal on to him who led the van.\r\n  He answered grossly as with trumpet blast.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[575] _From bridge to bridge_: They cross the barrier separating the\r\nFourth from the Fifth Bolgia, and follow the bridge which spans the\r\nFifth until they have reached the crown of it. We may infer that the\r\nconversation of Virgil and Dante turned on foreknowledge of the future.\r\n\r\n[576] _Darkness, etc._: The pitch with which the trench of the Bolgia is\r\nfilled absorbs most of the scanty light accorded to Malebolge.\r\n\r\n[577] _The Venetians_: But for this picturesque description of the old\r\nArsenal, and a passing mention of the Rialto in one passage of the\r\n_Paradiso_, and of the Venetian coinage in another, it could not be\r\ngathered from the _Comedy_, with all its wealth of historical and\r\ngeographical references, that there was such a place as Venice in the\r\nItaly of Dante. Unlike the statue of Time (_Inf._ xiv.), the Queen of\r\nthe Adriatic had her face set eastwards. Her back was turned and her\r\nears closed as in a proud indifference to the noise of party conflicts\r\nwhich filled the rest of Italy.\r\n\r\n[578] _A sinner_: This is the only instance in the _Inferno_ of the\r\narrival of a sinner at his special place of punishment. See _Inf._ v.\r\n15, _note_.\r\n\r\n[579] _Malebranche_: Evil Claws, the name of the devils who have the\r\nsinners of this Bolgia in charge.\r\n\r\n[580] _Santa Zita\'s town_: Zita was a holy serving-woman of Lucca, who\r\ndied some time between 1270 and 1280, and whose miracle-working body is\r\nstill preserved in the church of San Frediano. Most probably, although\r\nvenerated as a saint, she was not yet canonized at the time Dante writes\r\nof, and there may be a Florentine sneer hidden in the description of\r\nLucca as her town. Even in Lucca there was some difference of opinion as\r\nto her merits, and a certain unlucky Ciappaconi was pitched into the\r\nSerchio for making fun of the popular enthusiasm about her. See\r\nPhilalethes, _G\xc3\xb6tt. Com._ In Lucca the officials that were called Priors\r\nin Florence, were named Elders. The commentators give a name to this\r\nsinner, but it is only guesswork.\r\n\r\n[581] _Save Bonturo_, _barrates, etc._: It is the barrators, those who\r\ntrafficked in offices and sold justice, that are punished in this\r\nBolgia. The greatest barrator of all in Lucca, say the commentators, was\r\nthis Bonturo; but there seems no proof of it, though there is of his\r\narrogance. He was still living in 1314.\r\n\r\n[582] _The Sacred Countenance_: An image in cedar wood, of Byzantine\r\nworkmanship, still preserved and venerated in the cathedral of Lucca.\r\nAccording to the legend, it was carved from memory by Nicodemus, and\r\nafter being a long time lost was found again in the eighth century by an\r\nItalian bishop travelling in Palestine. He brought it to the coast at\r\nJoppa, where it was received by a vessel without sail or oar, which,\r\nwith its sacred freight, floated westwards and was next seen at the port\r\nof Luna. All efforts to approach the bark were vain, till the Bishop of\r\nLucca descended to the seashore, and to him the vessel resigned itself\r\nand suffered him to take the image into his keeping. \'Believe what you\r\nlike of all this,\' says Benvenuto; \'it is no article of faith.\'--The\r\nsinner has come to the surface, bent as if in an attitude of prayer,\r\nwhen he is met by this taunt.\r\n\r\n[583] _The Serchio_: The stream which flows past Lucca.\r\n\r\n[584] _A hundred hooks_: So many devils with their pronged hooks were\r\nwaiting to receive the victim. The punishment of the barrators bears a\r\nrelation to their sins. They wrought their evil deeds under all kinds of\r\nveils and excuses, and are now themselves effectually buried out of\r\nsight. The pitch sticks as close to them as bribes ever did to their\r\nfingers. They misused wards and all subject to them, and in their turn\r\nare clawed and torn by their devilish guardians.\r\n\r\n[585] _Formerly, etc._: On the occasion of his previous descent (_Inf._\r\nix. 22).\r\n\r\n[586] _The sixth bank_: Dante remains on the crown of the arch\r\noverhanging the pitch-filled moat. Virgil descends from the bridge by\r\nthe left hand to the bank on the inner side of the Fifth Bolgia.\r\n\r\n[587] _What will this, etc._: As if he said: What good will this delay\r\ndo him in the long-run?\r\n\r\n[588] _At Caprona_: Dante was one of the mounted militia sent by\r\nFlorence in 1289 to help the Lucchese against the Pisans, and was\r\npresent at the surrender by the Pisan garrison of the Castle of Caprona.\r\nSome make the reference to be to a siege of the same stronghold by the\r\nPisans in the following year, when the Lucchese garrison, having\r\nsurrendered on condition of having their lives spared, were met as they\r\nissued forth with cries of \'Hang them! Hang them!\' But of this second\r\nsiege it is only a Pisan commentator that speaks.\r\n\r\n[589] _The next rib_: Malacoda informs them that the arch of rock across\r\nthe Sixth Bolgia in continuation of that by which they have crossed the\r\nFifth is in ruins, but that they will find a whole bridge if they keep\r\nto the left hand along the rocky bank on the inner edge of the\r\npitch-filled moat. But, as appears further on, he is misleading them. It\r\nwill be remembered that from the precipice enclosing the Malebolge there\r\nrun more than one series of bridges or ribs into the central well of\r\nInferno.\r\n\r\n[590] _Yestreen, etc._: This is the principal passage in the _Comedy_\r\nfor fixing the date of the journey. It is now, according to the text,\r\ntwelve hundred and sixty-six years and a day since the crucifixion.\r\nTurning to the _Convito_, iv. 23, we find Dante giving his reasons for\r\nbelieving that Jesus, at His death, had just completed His thirty-fourth\r\nyear. This brings us to the date of 1300 A.D. But according to Church\r\ntradition the crucifixion happened on the 25th March, and to get\r\nthirty-four years His life must be counted from the incarnation, which\r\nwas held to have taken place on the same date, namely the 25th March. It\r\nwas in Dante\'s time optional to reckon from the incarnation or the birth\r\nof Christ. The journey must therefore be taken to have begun on Friday\r\nthe 25th March, a fortnight before the Good Friday of 1300; and,\r\ncounting strictly from the incarnation, on the first day of 1301--the\r\nfirst day of the new century. So we find Boccaccio in his unfinished\r\ncommentary saying in _Inf._ iii. that it will appear from Canto xxi.\r\nthat Dante began his journey in MCCCI.--The hour is now five hours\r\nbefore that at which the earthquake happened which took place at the\r\ndeath of Jesus. This is held by Dante (_Convito_ iv. 23), who professes\r\nto follow the account by Saint Luke, to have been at the sixth hour,\r\nthat is, at noon; thus the time is now seven in the morning.\r\n\r\n[591] _Alichino, etc._: The names of the devils are all descriptive:\r\nAlichino, for instance, is the Swooper; but in this and the next Canto\r\nwe have enough of the horrid crew without considering too closely how\r\nthey are called.\r\n\r\n[592] _Unbroken_: Malacoda repeats his lie.\r\n\r\n[593] _Each bit his tongue, etc._: The demons, aware of the cheat played\r\nby Malacoda, show their devilish humour by making game of Virgil and\r\nDante.--Benvenuto is amazed that a man so involved in his own thoughts\r\nas Dante was, should have been such a close observer of low life as this\r\npassage shows him. He is sure that he laughed to himself as he wrote the\r\nCanto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Horsemen I\'ve seen in march across the field,\r\n    Hastening to charge, or, answering muster, stand,\r\n    And sometimes too when forced their ground to yield;\r\n  I have seen skirmishers upon your land,\r\n    O Aretines![594] and those on foray sent;\r\n    With trumpet and with bell[595] to sound command\r\n  Have seen jousts run and well-fought tournament,\r\n    With drum, and signal from the castle shown,\r\n    And foreign music with familiar blent;\r\n  But ne\'er by blast on such a trumpet blown                        10\r\n    Beheld I horse or foot to motion brought,\r\n    Nor ship by star or landmark guided on.\r\n  With the ten demons moved we from the spot;\r\n    Ah, cruel company! but \'with the good\r\n    In church, and in the tavern with the sot.\'\r\n  Still to the pitch was my attention glued\r\n    Fully to see what in the Bolgia lay,\r\n    And who were in its burning mass imbrued.\r\n  As when the dolphins vaulted backs display,\r\n    Warning to mariners they should prepare                         20\r\n    To trim their vessel ere the storm makes way;\r\n  So, to assuage the pain he had to bear,\r\n    Some wretch would show his back above the tide,\r\n    Then swifter plunge than lightnings cleave the air.\r\n  And as the frogs close to the marsh\'s side\r\n    With muzzles thrust out of the water stand,\r\n    While feet and bodies carefully they hide;\r\n  So stood the sinners upon every hand.\r\n    But on beholding Barbariccia nigh\r\n    Beneath the bubbles[596] disappeared the band.                  30\r\n  I saw what still my heart is shaken by:\r\n    One waiting, as it sometimes comes to pass\r\n    That one frog plunges, one at rest doth lie;\r\n  And Graffiacan, who nearest to him was,\r\n    Him upward drew, clutching his pitchy hair:\r\n    To me he bore the look an otter has.\r\n  I of their names[597] ere this was well aware,\r\n    For I gave heed unto the names of all\r\n    When they at first were chosen. \'Now prepare,\r\n  And, Rubicante, with thy talons fall                              40\r\n    Upon him and flay well,\' with many cries\r\n    And one consent the accursed ones did call.\r\n  I said: \'O Master, if in any wise\r\n    Thou canst, find out who is the wretched wight\r\n    Thus at the mercy of his enemies.\'\r\n  Whereon my Guide drew full within his sight,\r\n    Asking him whence he came, and he replied:\r\n    \'In kingdom of Navarre[598] I first saw light.\r\n  Me servant to a lord my mother tied;\r\n    Through her I from a scoundrel sire did spring,                 50\r\n    Waster of goods and of himself beside.\r\n  As servant next to Thiebault,[599] righteous king,\r\n    I set myself to ply barratorship;\r\n    And in this heat discharge my reckoning.\'\r\n  And Ciriatto, close upon whose lip\r\n    On either side a boar-like tusk did stand,\r\n    Made him to feel how one of them could rip.\r\n  The mouse had stumbled on the wild cat band;\r\n    But Barbariccia locked him in embrace,\r\n    And, \'Off while I shall hug him!\' gave command.                 60\r\n  Round to my Master then he turned his face:\r\n    \'Ask more of him if more thou wouldest know,\r\n    While he against their fury yet finds grace.\'\r\n  My Leader asked: \'Declare now if below\r\n    The pitch \'mong all the guilty there lies here\r\n    A Latian?\'[600] He replied: \'Short while ago\r\n  From one[601] I parted who to them lived near;\r\n    And would that I might use him still for shield,\r\n    Then hook or claw I should no longer fear,\'\r\n  Said Libicocco: \'Too much grace we yield.\'                        70\r\n    And in the sinner\'s arm he fixed his hook,\r\n    And from it clean a fleshy fragment peeled.\r\n  But seeing Draghignazzo also took\r\n    Aim at his legs, the leader of the Ten\r\n    Turned swiftly round on them with angry look.\r\n  On this they were a little quieted; then\r\n    Of him who still gazed on his wound my Guide\r\n    Without delay demanded thus again:\r\n  \'Who was it whom, in coming to the side,\r\n    Thou say\'st thou didst do ill to leave behind?\'                 80\r\n    \'Gomita of Gallura,\'[602] he replied,\r\n  \'A vessel full of fraud of every kind,\r\n    Who, holding in his power his master\'s foes,\r\n    So used them him they bear in thankful mind;\r\n  For, taking bribes, he let slip all of those,\r\n    He says; and he in other posts did worse,\r\n    And as a chieftain \'mong barrators rose.\r\n  Don Michael Zanche[603] doth with him converse,\r\n   From Logodoro, and with endless din\r\n    They gossip[604] of Sardinian characters.                       90\r\n  But look, ah me! how yonder one doth grin.\r\n    More would I say, but that I am afraid\r\n    He is about to claw me on the skin.\'\r\n  To Farfarel the captain turned his head,\r\n    For, as about to swoop, he rolled his eye,\r\n    And, \'Cursed hawk, preserve thy distance!\' said.\r\n  \'If ye would talk with, or would closer spy,\'\r\n    The frighted wretch began once more to say,\r\n    \'Tuscans or Lombards, I will bring them nigh.\r\n  But let the Malebranche first give way,                          100\r\n    That of their vengeance they may not have fear,\r\n    And I to this same place where now I stay\r\n  For me, who am but one, will bring seven near\r\n    When I shall whistle as we use to do\r\n    Whenever on the surface we appear.\'\r\n  On this Cagnazzo up his muzzle threw,\r\n    Shaking his head and saying: \'Hear the cheat\r\n    He has contrived, to throw himself below.\'\r\n  Then he who in devices was complete:\r\n    \'Far too malicious, in good sooth,\' replied,                   110\r\n    \'When for my friends I plan a sorer fate.\'\r\n  This, Alichin withstood not but denied\r\n    The others\' counsel,[605] saying: \'If thou fling\r\n    Thyself hence, thee I strive not to outstride.\r\n  But o\'er the pitch I\'ll dart upon the wing.\r\n    Leave we the ridge,[606] and be the bank a shield;\r\n    And see if thou canst all of us outspring.\'\r\n  O Reader, hear a novel trick revealed.\r\n    All to the other side turned round their eyes,\r\n    He first[607] who slowest was the boon to yield.               120\r\n  In choice of time the Navarrese was wise;\r\n    Taking firm stand, himself he forward flung,\r\n    Eluding thus their hostile purposes.\r\n  Then with compunction each of them was stung,\r\n    But he the most[608] whose slackness made them fail;\r\n    Therefore he started, \'Caught!\' upon his tongue.\r\n  But little it bested, nor could prevail\r\n    His wings \'gainst fear. Below the other went,\r\n    While he with upturned breast aloft did sail.\r\n  And as the falcon, when, on its descent,                         130\r\n    The wild duck suddenly dives out of sight,\r\n    Returns outwitted back, and malcontent;\r\n  To be befooled filled Calcabrin with spite.\r\n    Hovering he followed, wishing in his mind\r\n    The wretch escaping should leave cause for fight.\r\n  When the barrator vanished, from behind\r\n    He on his comrade with his talons fell\r\n    And clawed him, \'bove the moat with him entwined.\r\n  The other was a spar-hawk terrible\r\n    To claw in turn; together then the two                         140\r\n    Plunged in the boiling pool. The heat full well\r\n  How to unlock their fierce embraces knew;\r\n    But yet they had no power[609] to rise again,\r\n    So were their wings all plastered o\'er with glue.\r\n  Then Barbariccia, mourning with his train,\r\n    Caused four to fly forth to the other side\r\n    With all their grapplers. Swift their flight was ta\'en.\r\n  Down to the place from either hand they glide,\r\n    Reaching their hooks to those who were limed fast,\r\n    And now beneath the scum were being fried.                     150\r\n  And from them thus engaged we onward passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[594] _O Aretines_: Dante is mentioned as having taken part in the\r\ncampaign of 1289 against Arezzo, in the course of which the battle of\r\nCampaldino was fought. But the text can hardly refer to what he\r\nwitnessed in that campaign, as the field of it was almost confined to\r\nthe Casentino, and little more than a formal entrance was made on the\r\ntrue Aretine territory; while the chronicles make no mention of jousts\r\nand forays. There is, however, no reason to think but that Dante was\r\nengaged in the attack made by Florence on the Ghibeline Arezzo in the\r\nearly summer of the preceding year. In a few days the Florentines and\r\ntheir allies had taken above forty castles and strongholds, and\r\ndevastated the enemy\'s country far and near; and, though unable to take\r\nthe capital, they held all kinds of warlike games in front of it. Dante\r\nwas then twenty-three years of age, and according to the Florentine\r\nconstitution of that period would, in a full muster of the militia, be\r\nrequired to serve as a cavalier without pay, and providing his own horse\r\nand arms.\r\n\r\n[595] _Bell_: The use of the bell for martial music was common in the\r\nItaly of the thirteenth century. The great war-bell of the Florentines\r\nwas carried with them into the field.\r\n\r\n[596] _Beneath the bubbles, etc._: As the barrators took toll of the\r\nadministration of justice and appointment to offices, something always\r\nsticking to their palms, so now they are plunged in the pitch; and as\r\nthey denied to others what should be the common blessing of justice, now\r\nthey cannot so much as breathe the air without paying dearly for it to\r\nthe demons.\r\n\r\n[597] _Their names_: The names of all the demons. All of them urge\r\nRubicante, the \'mad red devil,\' to flay the victim, shining and sleek\r\nwith the hot pitch, who is held fast by Graffiacane.\r\n\r\n[598] _In kingdom of Navarre, etc._: The commentators give the name of\r\nJohn Paul to this shade, but all that is known of him is found in the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n[599] _Thiebault_: King of Navarre and second of that name. He\r\naccompanied his father-in-law, Saint Louis, to Tunis, and died on his\r\nway back, in 1270.\r\n\r\n[600] _A Latian_: An Italian.\r\n\r\n[601] _From one, etc._: A Sardinian. The barrator prolongs his answer so\r\nas to procure a respite from the fangs of his tormentors.\r\n\r\n[602] _Gomita of Gallura_: \'Friar Gomita\' was high in favour with Nino\r\nVisconti (_Purg._ viii. 53), the lord of Gallura, one of the provinces\r\ninto which Sardinia was divided under the Pisans. At last, after bearing\r\nlong with him, the \'gentle Judge Nino\' hanged Gomita for setting\r\nprisoners free for bribes.\r\n\r\n[603] _Don Michael Zanche_: Enzo, King of Sardinia, married Adelasia,\r\nthe lady of Logodoro, one of the four Sardinian judgedoms or provinces.\r\nOf this province Zanche, seneschal to Enzo, acquired the government\r\nduring the long imprisonment of his master, or upon his death in 1273.\r\nZanche\'s daughter was married to Branca d\'Oria, by whom Zanche was\r\ntreacherously slain in 1275 (_Inf._ xxxiii. 137). There seems to be\r\nnothing extant to support the accusation implied in the text.\r\n\r\n[604] _They gossip, etc._: Zanche\'s experience of Sardinia was of an\r\nearlier date than Gomita\'s. It has been claimed for, or charged against,\r\nthe Sardinians, that more than other men they delight in gossip touching\r\ntheir native country. These two, if it can be supposed that, plunged\r\namong and choked with pitch, they still cared for Sardinian talk, would\r\nfind material enough in the troubled history of their land. In 1300 it\r\nbelonged partly to Genoa and partly to Pisa.\r\n\r\n[605] _The others\' counsel_: Alichino, confident in his own powers, is\r\nwilling to risk an experiment with the sinner. The other devils count a\r\nbird in the hand worth two in the bush.\r\n\r\n[606] _The ridge_: Not the crown of the great rocky barrier between the\r\nFifth and the Sixth Bolgias, for it is not on that the devils are\r\nstanding; neither are they allowed to pass over it (_Inf._ xxiii. 55).\r\nWe are to figure them to ourselves as standing on a ledge running\r\nbetween the fosse and the foot of the enclosing rocky steep--a pathway\r\ncontinued under the bridges and all round the Bolgia for their\r\nconvenience as guardians of it. The bank adjoining the pitch will serve\r\nas a screen for the sinner if the demons retire to the other side of\r\nthis ledge.\r\n\r\n[607] _He first, etc._: Cagnazzo. See line 106.\r\n\r\n[608] _He the most, etc._: Alichino, whose confidence in his agility had\r\nled to the outwitting of the band.\r\n\r\n[609] _No power_: The foolish ineptitude of the devils for anything\r\nbeyond their special function of hooking up and flaying those who appear\r\non the surface of the pitch, and their irrational fierce playfulness as\r\nof tiger cubs, convey a vivid impression of the limits set to their\r\ndiabolical power, and at the same time heighten the sense of what\r\nDante\'s feeling of insecurity must have been while in such inhuman\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Silent, alone, not now with company\r\n    We onward went, one first and one behind,\r\n    As Minor Friars[610] use to make their way.\r\n  On \xc3\x86sop\'s fable[611] wholly was my mind\r\n    Intent, by reason of that contest new--\r\n    The fable where the frog and mouse we find;\r\n  For _Mo_ and _Issa_[612] are not more of hue\r\n    Than like the fable shall the fact appear,\r\n    If but considered with attention due.\r\n  And as from one thought springs the next, so here                 10\r\n    Out of my first arose another thought,\r\n    Until within me doubled was my fear.\r\n  For thus I judged: Seeing through us[613] were brought\r\n    Contempt upon them, hurt, and sore despite,\r\n    They needs must be to deep vexation wrought.\r\n  If anger to malevolence unite,\r\n    Then will they us more cruelly pursue\r\n    Than dog the hare which almost feels its bite.\r\n  All my hair bristled, I already knew,\r\n    With terror when I spake: \'O Master, try                        20\r\n    To hide us quick\' (and back I turned to view\r\n  What lay behind), \'for me they terrify,\r\n    These Malebranche following us; from dread\r\n    I almost fancy I can feel them nigh.\'\r\n  And he: \'Were I a mirror backed with lead\r\n    I should no truer glass that form of thine,\r\n    Than all thy thought by mine is answered.\r\n  For even now thy thoughts accord with mine,\r\n    Alike in drift and featured with one face;\r\n    And to suggest one counsel they combine.                        30\r\n  If the right bank slope downward at this place,\r\n    To the next Bolgia[614] offering us a way,\r\n    Swiftly shall we evade the imagined chase.\'\r\n  Ere he completely could his purpose say,\r\n    I saw them with their wings extended wide,\r\n    Close on us; as of us to make their prey.\r\n  Then quickly was I snatched up by my Guide:\r\n    Even as a mother when, awaked by cries,\r\n    She sees the flames are kindling at her side,\r\n  Delaying not, seizes her child and flies;                         40\r\n    Careful for him her proper danger mocks,\r\n    Nor even with one poor shift herself supplies.\r\n  And he, stretched out upon the flinty rocks,\r\n    Himself unto the precipice resigned\r\n    Which one side of the other Bolgia blocks.\r\n  A swifter course ne\'er held a stream confined,\r\n    That it may turn a mill, within its race,\r\n    Where near the buckets \'tis the most declined\r\n  Than was my Master\'s down that rock\'s sheer face;\r\n    Nor seemed I then his comrade, as we sped,                      50\r\n    But like a son locked in a sire\'s embrace.\r\n  And barely had his feet struck on the bed\r\n    Of the low ground, when they were seen to stand\r\n    Upon the crest, no more a cause of dread.[615]\r\n  For Providence supreme, who so had planned\r\n    In the Fifth Bolgia they should minister,\r\n    Them wholly from departure thence had banned.\r\n  \'Neath us we saw a painted people fare,\r\n    Weeping as on their way they circled slow,\r\n    Crushed by fatigue to look at, and despair.                     60\r\n  Cloaks had they on with hoods pulled down full low\r\n    Upon their eyes, and fashioned, as it seemed,\r\n    Like those which at Cologne[616] for monks they sew.\r\n  The outer face was gilt so that it gleamed;\r\n    Inside was all of lead, of such a weight\r\n    Frederick\'s[617] to these had been but straw esteemed.\r\n  O weary robes for an eternal state!\r\n    With them we turned to the left hand once more,\r\n    Intent upon their tears disconsolate.\r\n  But those folk, wearied with the loads they bore,                 70\r\n    So slowly crept that still new company\r\n    Was ours at every footfall on the floor.\r\n  Whence to my Guide I said: \'Do thou now try\r\n    To find some one by name or action known,\r\n    And as we go on all sides turn thine eye.\'\r\n  And one, who recognised the Tuscan tone,\r\n    Called from behind us: \'Halt, I you entreat\r\n    Who through the air obscure are hastening on;\r\n  Haply in me thou what thou seek\'st shalt meet.\'\r\n    Whereon my Guide turned round and said: \'Await,\r\n    And keep thou time with pacing of his feet.\'                    81\r\n  I stood, and saw two manifesting great\r\n    Desire to join me, by their countenance;\r\n    But their loads hampered them and passage strait.[618]\r\n  And, when arrived, me with an eye askance[619]\r\n    They gazed on long time, but no word they spoke;\r\n    Then, to each other turned, held thus parlance:\r\n  \'His heaving throat[620] proves him of living folk.\r\n    If they are of the dead, how could they gain\r\n    To walk uncovered by the heavy cloak?\'                          90\r\n  Then to me: \'Tuscan, who dost now attain\r\n    To the college of the hypocrites forlorn,\r\n    To tell us who thou art show no disdain.\'\r\n  And I to them: \'I was both bred and born\r\n    In the great city by fair Arno\'s stream,\r\n    And wear the body I have always worn.\r\n  But who are ye, whose suffering supreme\r\n    Makes tears, as I behold, to flood the cheek;\r\n    And what your mode of pain that thus doth gleam?\'\r\n  \'Ah me, the yellow mantles,\' one to speak                        100\r\n    Began, \'are all of lead so thick, its weight\r\n    Maketh the scales after this manner creak.\r\n  We, Merry Friars[621] of Bologna\'s state,\r\n    I Catalano, Loderingo he,\r\n    Were by thy town together designate,\r\n  As for the most part one is used to be,\r\n    To keep the peace within it; and around\r\n    Gardingo,[622] what we were men still may see.\'\r\n  I made beginning: \'Friars, your profound--\'\r\n    But said no more, on suddenly seeing there                     110\r\n    One crucified by three stakes to the ground,\r\n  Who, when he saw me, writhed as in despair,\r\n    Breathing into his beard with heavy sigh.\r\n    And Friar Catalan, of this aware,\r\n  Said: \'He thus fixed, on whom thou turn\'st thine eye,\r\n    Counselled the Pharisees that it behoved\r\n    One man as victim[623] for the folk should die.\r\n  Naked, thou seest, he lies, and ne\'er removed\r\n    From where, set \'cross the path, by him the weight\r\n    Of every one that passes by is proved.                         120\r\n  And his wife\'s father shares an equal fate,\r\n    With others of the Council, in this fosse;\r\n    For to the Jews they proved seed reprobate.\'\r\n  Meanwhile at him thus stretched upon the cross\r\n    Virgil,[624] I saw, displayed astonishment--\r\n    At his mean exile and eternal loss.\r\n  And then this question to the Friars he sent:\r\n    \'Be not displeased, but, if ye may, avow\r\n    If on the right[625] hand there lies any vent\r\n  By which we, both of us,[626] from hence may go,                 130\r\n    Nor need the black angelic company\r\n    To come to help us from this valley low.\'\r\n  \'Nearer than what thou think\'st,\' he made reply,\r\n    \'A rib there runs from the encircling wall,[627]\r\n    The cruel vales in turn o\'erarching high;\r\n  Save that at this \'tis rent and ruined all.\r\n    Ye can climb upward o\'er the shattered heap\r\n    Where down the side the piled-up fragments fall.\'\r\n  His head bent down a while my Guide did keep,\r\n    Then said: \'He warned us[628] in imperfect wise,               140\r\n    Who sinners with his hook doth clutch and steep.\'\r\n  The Friar: \'At Bologna[629] many a vice\r\n    I heard the Devil charged with, and among\r\n    The rest that, false, he father is of lies.\'\r\n  Then onward moved my Guide with paces long,\r\n    And some slight shade of anger on his face.\r\n    I with him parted from the burdened throng,\r\n  Stepping where those dear feet had left their trace.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[610] _Minor Friars_: In the early years of their Order the Franciscans\r\nwent in couples upon their journeys, not abreast but one behind the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[611] _\xc3\x86sop\'s fable_: This fable, mistakenly attributed to \xc3\x86sop, tells\r\nof how a frog enticed a mouse into a pond, and how they were then both\r\ndevoured by a kite. To discover the aptness of the simile would scarcely\r\nbe reward enough for the continued mental effort Dante enjoins. So much\r\nwas everything Greek or Roman then held in reverence, that the mention\r\neven of \xc3\x86sop is held to give dignity to the page.\r\n\r\n[612] _Mo_ and _Issa_: Two words for _now_.\r\n\r\n[613] _Through us_: The quarrel among the fiends arose from Dante\'s\r\ninsatiable desire to confer with \'Tuscan or Lombard.\'\r\n\r\n[614] _To the next Bolgia_: The Sixth. They are now on the top of the\r\ncircular ridge that divides it from the Fifth. From the construction of\r\nMalebolge the ridge is deeper on the inner side than on that up which\r\nthey have travelled from the pitch.\r\n\r\n[615] _No more a cause of dread_: There seems some incongruity between\r\nVirgil\'s dread of these smaller devils and the ease with which he cowed\r\nMinos, Charon, and Pluto. But his character gains in human interest the\r\nmore he is represented as sympathising with Dante in his terrors; and in\r\nthis particular case the confession of fellow-feeling prepares the way\r\nfor the beautiful passage which follows it (line 38, etc.), one full of\r\nan almost modern tenderness.\r\n\r\n[616] _Cologne_: Some make it Clugny, the great Benedictine monastery;\r\nbut all the old commentators and most of the mss. read Cologne. All that\r\nthe text necessarily carries is that the cloaks had great hoods. If, in\r\naddition, a reproach of clumsiness is implied, it would agree well\r\nenough with the Italian estimate of German people and things.\r\n\r\n[617] _Frederick\'s, etc._: The Emperor Frederick II.; but that he used\r\nany torture of leaden sheets seems to be a fabrication of his enemies.\r\n\r\n[618] _Passage strait_: Through the crowd of shades, all like themselves\r\nweighed down by the leaden cloaks. There is nothing in all literature\r\nlike this picture of the heavily-burdened shades. At first sight it\r\nseems to be little of a torture compared with what we have already seen,\r\nand yet by simple touch after touch an impression is created of the\r\nintolerable weariness of the victims. As always, too, the punishment\r\nanswers to the sin. The hypocrites made a fair show in the flesh, and\r\nnow their mantles which look like gold are only of base lead. On earth\r\nthey were of a sad countenance, trying to seem better than they were,\r\nand the load which to deceive others they voluntarily assumed in life is\r\nnow replaced by a still heavier weight, and one they cannot throw off if\r\nthey would. The choice of garb conveys an obvious charge of hypocrisy\r\nagainst the Friars, then greatly fallen away from the purity of their\r\ninstitution, whether Franciscans or Dominicans.\r\n\r\n[619] _An eye askance_: They cannot turn their heads.\r\n\r\n[620] _His heaving throat_: In Purgatory Dante is known for a mortal by\r\nhis casting a shadow. Here he is known to be of flesh and blood by the\r\nact of respiration; yet, as appears from line 113, the shades, too,\r\nbreathe as well as perform other functions of living bodies. At least\r\nthey seem so to do, but this is all only in appearance. They only seem\r\nto be flesh and blood, having no weight, casting no shadow, and drawing\r\nbreath in a way of their own. Dante, as has been said (_Inf._ vi. 36),\r\nis hard put to it to make them subject to corporal pains and yet be only\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n[621] _Merry Friars_: Knights of the Order of Saint Mary, instituted by\r\nUrban IV. in 1261. Whether the name of Frati Godenti which they here\r\nbear was one of reproach or was simply descriptive of the easy rule\r\nunder which they lived, is not known. Married men might, under certain\r\nconditions, enter the Order. The members were to hold themselves aloof\r\nfrom public office, and were to devote themselves to the defence of the\r\nweak and the promotion of justice and religion. The two monkish\r\ncavaliers of the text were in 1266 brought to Florence as Podestas, the\r\nPope himself having urged them to go. There is much uncertainty as to\r\nthe part they played in Florence, but none as to the fact of their rule\r\nhaving been highly distasteful to the Florentines, or as to the other\r\nfact, that in Florence they grew wealthy. The Podesta, or chief\r\nmagistrate, was always a well-born foreigner. Probably some monkish rule\r\nor custom forbade either Catalano or Loderingo to leave the monastery\r\nsingly.\r\n\r\n[622] _Gardingo_: A quarter of Florence, in which many palaces were\r\ndestroyed about the time of the Podestaship of the Frati.\r\n\r\n[623] _One man as victim_: _St. John_ xi. 50. Caiaphas and Annas, with\r\nthe Scribes and Pharisees who persecuted Jesus to the death, are the\r\nvilest hypocrites of all. They lie naked across the path, unburdened by\r\nthe leaden cloak, it is true, but only that they may feel the more\r\nkeenly the weight of the punishment of all the hypocrites of the world.\r\n\r\n[624] _Virgil_: On Virgil\'s earlier journey through Inferno Caiaphas and\r\nthe others were not here, and he wonders as at something out of a world\r\nto him unknown.\r\n\r\n[625] _On the right_: As they are moving round the Bolgia to the left,\r\nthe rocky barrier between them and the Seventh Bolgia is on their right.\r\n\r\n[626] _We, both of us_: Dante, still in the body, as well as Virgil, the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\n[627] _The encircling wall_: That which encloses all the Malebolge.\r\n\r\n[628] _He warned us_: Malacoda (_Inf._ xxi. 109) had assured him that\r\nthe next rib of rock ran unbroken across all the Bolgias, but it too,\r\nlike all the other bridges, proves to have been, at the time of the\r\nearthquake, shattered where it crossed this gulf of the hypocrites. The\r\nearthquake told most on this Bolgia, because the death of Christ and the\r\nattendant earthquake were, in a sense, caused by the hypocrisy of\r\nCaiaphas and the rest.\r\n\r\n[629] _At Bologna_: Even in Inferno the Merry Friar must have his joke.\r\nHe is a gentleman, but a bit of a scholar too; and the University of\r\nBologna is to him what Marischal College was to Captain Dalgetty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In season of the new year, when the sun\r\n    Beneath Aquarius[630] warms again his hair,\r\n    And somewhat on the nights the days have won;\r\n  When on the ground the hoar-frost painteth fair\r\n    A mimic image of her sister white--\r\n    But soon her brush of colour is all bare--\r\n  The clown, whose fodder is consumed outright,\r\n    Rises and looks abroad, and, all the plain\r\n    Beholding glisten, on his thigh doth smite.\r\n  Returned indoors, like wretch that seeks in vain                  10\r\n    What he should do, restless he mourns his case;\r\n    But hope revives when, looking forth again,\r\n  He sees the earth anew has changed its face.\r\n    Then with his crook he doth himself provide,\r\n    And straightway doth his sheep to pasture chase:\r\n  So at my Master was I terrified,\r\n    His brows beholding troubled; nor more slow\r\n    To where I ailed[631] the plaster was applied.\r\n  For when the broken bridge[632] we stood below\r\n    My Guide turned to me with the expression sweet                 20\r\n    Which I beneath the mountain learned to know.\r\n  His arms he opened, after counsel meet\r\n    Held with himself, and, scanning closely o\'er\r\n    The fragments first, he raised me from my feet;\r\n  And like a man who, working, looks before,\r\n    With foresight still on that in front bestowed,\r\n    Me to the summit of a block he bore\r\n  And then to me another fragment showed,\r\n    Saying: \'By this thou now must clamber on;\r\n    But try it first if it will bear thy load.\'                     30\r\n  The heavy cowled[633] this way could ne\'er have gone,\r\n    For hardly we, I holpen, he so light,\r\n    Could clamber up from shattered stone to stone.\r\n  And but that on the inner bank the height\r\n    Of wall is not so great, I say not he,\r\n    But for myself I had been vanquished quite.\r\n  But Malebolge[634] to the cavity\r\n    Of the deep central pit is planned to fall;\r\n    Hence every Bolgia in its turn must be\r\n  High on the out, low on the inner wall;                           40\r\n    So to the summit we attained at last,\r\n    Whence breaks away the topmost stone[635] of all.\r\n  My lungs were so with breathlessness harassed,\r\n    The summit won, I could no further go;\r\n    And, hardly there, me on the ground I cast\r\n  \'Well it befits that thou shouldst from thee throw\r\n    All sloth,\' the Master said; \'for stretched in down\r\n    Or under awnings none can glory know.\r\n  And he who spends his life nor wins renown\r\n    Leaves in the world no more enduring trace                      50\r\n    Than smoke in air, or foam on water blown.\r\n  Therefore arise; o\'ercome thy breathlessness\r\n    By force of will, victor in every fight\r\n    When not subservient to the body base.\r\n  Of stairs thou yet must climb a loftier flight:[636]\r\n    \'Tis not enough to have ascended these.\r\n    Up then and profit if thou hear\'st aright.\'\r\n  Rising I feigned to breathe with greater ease\r\n    Than what I felt, and spake: \'Now forward plod,\r\n    For with my courage now my strength agrees.\'                    60\r\n  Up o\'er the rocky rib we held our road;\r\n    And rough it was and difficult and strait,\r\n    And steeper far[637] than that we earlier trod.\r\n  Speaking I went, to hide my wearied state,\r\n    When from the neighbouring moat a voice we heard\r\n    Which seemed ill fitted to articulate.\r\n  Of what it said I knew not any word,\r\n    Though on the arch[638] that vaults the moat set high;\r\n    But he who spake appeared by anger stirred.\r\n  Though I bent downward yet my eager eye,                          70\r\n    So dim the depth, explored it all in vain;\r\n    I then: \'O Master, to that bank draw nigh,\r\n  And let us by the wall descent obtain,\r\n    Because I hear and do not understand,\r\n    And looking down distinguish nothing plain.\'\r\n  \'My sole reply to thee,\' he answered bland,\r\n    \'Is to perform; for it behoves,\' he said,\r\n    \'With silent act to answer just demand.\'\r\n  Then we descended from the bridge\'s head,[639]\r\n    Where with the eighth bank is its junction wrought;             80\r\n    And full beneath me was the Bolgia spread.\r\n  And I perceived that hideously \'twas fraught\r\n    With serpents; and such monstrous forms they bore,\r\n    Even now my blood is curdled at the thought.\r\n  Henceforth let sandy Libya boast no more!\r\n    Though she breed hydra, snake that crawls or flies,\r\n    Twy-headed, or fine-speckled, no such store\r\n  Of plagues, nor near so cruel, she supplies,\r\n    Though joined to all the land of Ethiop,\r\n    And that which by the Red Sea waters lies.                      90\r\n  \'Midst this fell throng and dismal, without hope\r\n    A naked people ran, aghast with fear--\r\n    No covert for them and no heliotrope.[640]\r\n  Their hands[641] were bound by serpents at their rear,\r\n    Which in their reins for head and tail did get\r\n    A holding-place: in front they knotted were.\r\n  And lo! to one who on our side was set\r\n    A serpent darted forward, him to bite\r\n    At where the neck is by the shoulders met.\r\n  Nor _O_ nor _I_ did any ever write                               100\r\n    More quickly than he kindled, burst in flame,\r\n    And crumbled all to ashes. And when quite\r\n  He on the earth a wasted heap became,\r\n    The ashes[642] of themselves together rolled,\r\n    Resuming suddenly their former frame.\r\n  Thus, as by mighty sages we are told,\r\n    The Phoenix[643] dies, and then is born again,\r\n    When it is close upon five centuries old.\r\n  In all its life it eats not herb nor grain,\r\n    But only tears that from frankincense flow;                    110\r\n    It, for a shroud, sweet nard and myrrh contain.\r\n  And as the man who falls and knows not how,\r\n    By force of demons stretched upon the ground,\r\n    Or by obstruction that makes life run low,\r\n  When risen up straight gazes all around\r\n    In deep confusion through the anguish keen\r\n    He suffered from, and stares with sighs profound:\r\n  So was the sinner, when arisen, seen.\r\n    Justice of God, how are thy terrors piled,\r\n    Showering in vengeance blows thus big with teen!               120\r\n  My Guide then asked of him how he was styled.\r\n    Whereon he said: \'From Tuscany I rained,\r\n    Not long ago, into this gullet wild.\r\n  From bestial life, not human, joy I gained,\r\n    Mule that I was; me, Vanni Fucci,[644] brute,\r\n    Pistoia, fitting den, in life contained.\'\r\n  I to my Guide: \'Bid him not budge a foot,\r\n    And ask[645] what crime has plunged him here below.\r\n    In rage and blood I knew him dissolute.\'\r\n  The sinner heard, nor insincere did show,                        130\r\n    But towards me turned his face and eke his mind,\r\n    With spiteful shame his features all aglow;\r\n  Then said: \'It pains me more thou shouldst me find\r\n    And catch me steeped in all this misery,\r\n    Than when the other life I left behind.\r\n  What thou demandest I can not deny:\r\n    I\'m plunged[646] thus low because the thief I played\r\n    Within the fairly furnished sacristy;\r\n  And falsely to another\'s charge \'twas laid.\r\n    Lest thou shouldst joy[647] such sight has met thy view\r\n    If e\'er these dreary regions thou evade,                       141\r\n  Give ear and hearken to my utterance true:\r\n    The Neri first out of Pistoia fail,\r\n    Her laws and parties Florence shapes anew;\r\n  Mars draws a vapour out of Magra\'s vale,\r\n    Which black and threatening clouds accompany:\r\n    Then bursting in a tempest terrible\r\n  Upon Piceno shall the war run high;\r\n    The mist by it shall suddenly be rent,\r\n    And every Bianco[648] smitten be thereby:                      150\r\n  And I have told thee that thou mayst lament.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[630] _Aquarius_: The sun is in the constellation of Aquarius from the\r\nend of January till the end of February; and already, say in the middle\r\nof February, the day is nearly as long as the night.\r\n\r\n[631] _Where I ailed, etc._: As the peasant is in despair at seeing the\r\nearth white with what he thinks is snow, so was Dante at the signs of\r\ntrouble on Virgil\'s face. He has mistaken anger at the cheat for\r\nperplexity as to how they are to escape from the Bolgia; and his\r\nMaster\'s smile is grateful and reassuring to him as the spectacle of the\r\ngreen earth to the despairing shepherd.\r\n\r\n[632] _The broken bridge_: They are about to escape from the bottom of\r\nthe Sixth Bolgia by climbing the wall between it and the Seventh, at the\r\npoint where the confused fragments of the bridge Friar Catalano told\r\nthem of (_Inf._ xxiii. 133) lie piled up against the wall, and yield\r\nsomething of a practicable way.\r\n\r\n[633] _The heavy cowled_: He finds his illustration on the spot, his\r\nmind being still full of the grievously burdened hypocrites.\r\n\r\n[634] _But Malebolge, etc._: Each Bolgia in turn lies at a lower level\r\nthan the one before it, and consequently the inner side of each dividing\r\nridge or wall is higher than the outer; or, to put it otherwise, in each\r\nBolgia the wall they come to last--that nearest the centre of the\r\nInferno, is lower than that they first reach--the one enclosing the\r\nBolgia.\r\n\r\n[635] _The topmost stone_: The stone that had formed the beginning of\r\nthe arch at this end of it.\r\n\r\n[636] _A loftier flight_: When he ascends the Mount of Purgatory.\r\n\r\n[637] _Steeper far, etc._: Rougher and steeper than the rib of rock they\r\nfollowed till they had crossed the Fifth Bolgia. They are now travelling\r\nalong a different spoke of the wheel.\r\n\r\n[638] _The arch, etc._: He has gone on hiding his weariness till he is\r\non the top of the arch that overhangs the Seventh Bolgia--that in which\r\nthieves are punished.\r\n\r\n[639] _Front the bridge\'s head_: Further on they climb up again (_Inf._\r\nxxvi. 13) by the projecting stones which now supply them with the means\r\nof descent. It is a disputed point how far they do descend. Clearly it\r\nis further than merely from the bridge to the lower level of the wall\r\ndividing the Seventh from the Eighth Bolgia; but not so far as to the\r\nground of the moat. Most likely the stones jut forth at the angle formed\r\nby the junction of the bridge and the rocky wall. On one of the lowest\r\nof these they find a standing-place whence they can see clearly what is\r\nin the Bolgia.\r\n\r\n[640] _Heliotrope_: A stone supposed to make the bearer of it invisible.\r\n\r\n[641] _Their hands, etc._: The sinners in this Bolgia are the thieves,\r\nnot the violent robbers and highwaymen but those crime involves a\r\nbetrayal of trust. After all their cunning thefts they are naked now;\r\nand, though here is nothing to steal, hands are firmly bound behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[642] _The ashes, etc._: The sufferings of the thieves, if looked\r\nclosely into, will be found appropriate to their sins. They would fain\r\nbut cannot steal themselves away, and in addition to the constant terror\r\nof being found out they are subject to pains the essence of which\r\nconsists in the deprivation--the theft from them--of their unsubstantial\r\nbodies, which are all that they now have to lose. In the case of this\r\nvictim the deprivation is only temporary.\r\n\r\n[643] _The Phoenix_: Dante here borrows very directly from Ovid\r\n(_Metam._ xv.).\r\n\r\n[644] _Vanni Fucci_: Natural son of a Pistoiese noble and a poet of some\r\nmerit, who bore a leading part in the ruthless feuds of Blacks and\r\nWhites which distracted Pistoia towards the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[645] _And ask, etc._: Dante wishes to find out why Fucci is placed\r\namong the thieves, and not in the circle of the violent. The question is\r\nframed so as to compel confession of a crime for which the sinner had\r\nnot been condemned in life; and he flushes with rage at being found\r\namong the cowardly thieves.\r\n\r\n[646] _I\'m plunged, etc._: Fucci was concerned in the theft of treasure\r\nfrom the Cathedral Church of St. James at Pistoia. Accounts vary as to\r\nthe circumstances under which the crime was committed, and as to who\r\nsuffered for it. Neither is it certainly known when Fucci died, though\r\nhis recent arrival in the Bolgia agrees with the view that he was still\r\nactive on the side of the Blacks in the last year of the century. In the\r\nfierceness of his retort to Dante we have evidence of their old\r\nacquaintance and old enmity.\r\n\r\n[647] _Lest thou shouldst joy_: Vanni, a _Nero_ or Black, takes his\r\nrevenge for being found here by Dante, who was, as he knew, associated\r\nwith the _Bianchi_ or Whites, by prophesying an event full of disaster\r\nto these.\r\n\r\n[648] _Every Bianco, etc._: The Blacks, according to Villani (viii. 45),\r\nwere driven from Pistoia in May 1301. They took refuge in Florence,\r\nwhere their party, in the following November under the protection of\r\nCharles of Valois, finally gained the upper hand, and began to persecute\r\nand expel the Whites, among whom was Dante. Mars, the god of war, or,\r\nmore probably, the planet of war, draws a vapour from the valley of the\r\nMagra, a small stream which flows into the Mediterranean on the northern\r\nconfine of Tuscany. This vapour is said to signify Moroello Malaspina, a\r\nnoble of that district and an active leader of the Blacks, who here\r\nfigure as murky clouds. The Campo Piceno is the country west of Pistoia.\r\nThere Moroello bursts on his foes like a lightning-flash out of its\r\ncloud. This seems to refer to a pitched battle that should have happened\r\nsoon after the Blacks recovered their strength; but the chroniclers tell\r\nof none such, though some of the commentators do. The fortress of\r\nSeravalle was taken from the Pistoiese, it is true, in 1302, and\r\nMoroello is said to have been the leader of the force which starved it\r\ninto submission. He was certainly present at the great siege of Pistoia\r\nin 1305, when the citizens suffered the last rigours of famine.--This\r\nprophecy by Fucci recalls those by Farinata and Ciacco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The robber,[649] when his words were ended so,\r\n    Made both the figs and lifted either fist,\r\n    Shouting: \'There, God! for them at thee I throw.\'\r\n  Then were the snakes my friends; for one \'gan twist\r\n    And coiled itself around the sinner\'s throat,\r\n    As if to say: \'Now would I have thee whist.\'\r\n  Another seized his arms and made a knot,\r\n    Clinching itself upon them in such wise\r\n    He had no power to move them by a jot.\r\n  Pistoia![650] thou, Pistoia, shouldst devise                      10\r\n    To burn thyself to ashes, since thou hast\r\n    Outrun thy founders in iniquities.\r\n  The blackest depths of Hell through which I passed\r\n    Showed me no soul \'gainst God so filled with spite,\r\n    No, not even he who down Thebes\' wall[651] was cast.\r\n  He spake no further word, but turned to flight;\r\n    And I beheld a Centaur raging sore\r\n    Come shouting: \'Of the ribald give me sight!\'\r\n  I scarce believe Maremma[652] yieldeth more\r\n    Snakes of all kinds than what composed the load                 20\r\n    Which on his back, far as our form, he bore.\r\n  Behind his nape, with pinions spread abroad,\r\n    A dragon couchant on his shoulders lay\r\n    To set on fire whoever bars his road.\r\n  \'This one is Cacus,\'[653] did my Master say,\r\n    \'Who underneath the rock of Aventine\r\n    Watered a pool with blood day after day.\r\n  Not with his brethren[654] runs he in the line,\r\n    Because of yore the treacherous theft he wrought\r\n    Upon the neighbouring wealthy herd of kine:                     30\r\n  Whence to his crooked course an end was brought\r\n    \'Neath Hercules\' club, which on him might shower down\r\n    A hundred blows; ere ten he suffered nought.\'\r\n  While this he said, the other had passed on;\r\n    And under us three spirits forward pressed\r\n    Of whom my Guide and I had nothing known\r\n  But that: \'Who are ye?\' they made loud request.\r\n    Whereon our tale[655] no further could proceed;\r\n    And toward them wholly we our wits addressed.\r\n  I recognised them not, but gave good heed;                        40\r\n    Till, as it often haps in such a case,\r\n    To name another, one discovered need,\r\n  Saying: \'Now where stopped Cianfa[656] in the race?\'\r\n    Then, that my Guide might halt and hearken well,\r\n    On chin[657] and nose I did my finger place.\r\n  If, Reader, to believe what now I tell\r\n    Thou shouldst be slow, I wonder not, for I\r\n    Who saw it all scarce find it credible.\r\n  While I on them my brows kept lifted high\r\n    A serpent, which had six feet, suddenly flew                    50\r\n    At one of them and held him bodily.\r\n  Its middle feet about his paunch it drew,\r\n    And with the two in front his arms clutched fast,\r\n    And bit one cheek and the other through and through.\r\n  Its hinder feet upon his thighs it cast,\r\n    Thrusting its tail between them till behind,\r\n    Distended o\'er his reins, it upward passed.\r\n  The ivy to a tree could never bind\r\n    Itself so firmly as this dreadful beast\r\n    Its members with the other\'s intertwined.                       60\r\n  Each lost the colour that it once possessed,\r\n    And closely they, like heated wax, unite,\r\n    The former hue of neither manifest:\r\n  Even so up o\'er papyrus,[658] when alight,\r\n    Before the flame there spreads a colour dun,\r\n    Not black as yet, though from it dies the white.\r\n  The other two meanwhile were looking on,\r\n    Crying: \'Agnello, how art thou made new!\r\n    Thou art not twain, and yet no longer one.\'\r\n  A single head was moulded out of two;                             70\r\n    And on our sight a single face arose,\r\n    Which out of both lost countenances grew.\r\n  Four separate limbs did but two arms compose;\r\n    Belly with chest, and legs with thighs did grow\r\n    To members such as nought created shows.\r\n  Their former fashion was all perished now:\r\n    The perverse shape did both, yet neither seem;\r\n    And, thus transformed, departed moving slow.\r\n  And as the lizard, which at fierce extreme\r\n    Of dog-day heat another hedge would gain,                       80\r\n    Flits \'cross the path swift as the lightning\'s gleam;\r\n  Right for the bellies of the other twain\r\n    A little snake[659] quivering with anger sped,\r\n    Livid and black as is a pepper grain,\r\n  And on the part by which we first are fed\r\n    Pierced one of them; and then upon the ground\r\n    It fell before him, and remained outspread.\r\n  The wounded gazed on it, but made no sound.\r\n    Rooted he stood[660] and yawning, scarce awake,\r\n    As seized by fever or by sleep profound.                        90\r\n  It closely watched him and he watched the snake,\r\n    While from its mouth and from his wound \'gan swell\r\n    Volumes of smoke which joined one cloud to make.\r\n  Be Lucan henceforth dumb, nor longer tell\r\n    Of plagued Sabellus and Nassidius,[661]\r\n    But, hearkening to what follows, mark it well.\r\n  Silent be Ovid: of him telling us\r\n    How Cadmus[662] to a snake, and to a fount\r\n    Changed Arethuse,[663] I am not envious;\r\n  For never of two natures front to front                          100\r\n    In metamorphosis, while mutually\r\n    The forms[664] their matter changed, he gives account.\r\n  \'Twas thus that each to the other made reply:\r\n    Its tail into a fork the serpent split;\r\n    Bracing his feet the other pulled them nigh:\r\n  And then in one so thoroughly were knit\r\n    His legs and thighs, no searching could divine\r\n    At where the junction had been wrought in it.\r\n  The shape, of which the one lost every sign,\r\n    The cloven tail was taking; then the skin                      110\r\n    Of one grew rough, the other\'s soft and fine.\r\n  I by the armpits saw the arms drawn in;\r\n    And now the monster\'s feet, which had been small,\r\n    What the other\'s lost in length appeared to win.\r\n  Together twisted, its hind feet did fall\r\n    And grew the member men are used to hide:\r\n    For his the wretch gained feet with which to crawl.\r\n  Dyed in the smoke they took on either side\r\n    A novel colour: hair unwonted grew\r\n    On one; the hair upon the other died.                          120\r\n  The one fell prone, erect the other drew,\r\n    With cruel eyes continuing to glare,\r\n    \'Neath which their muzzles metamorphose knew.\r\n  The erect to his brows drew his. Of stuff to spare\r\n    Of what he upward pulled, there was no lack;\r\n    So ears were formed on cheeks that erst were bare.\r\n  Of that which clung in front nor was drawn back,\r\n    Superfluous, on the face was formed a nose,\r\n    And lips absorbed the skin that still was slack.\r\n  His muzzle who lay prone now forward goes;                       130\r\n    Backward into his head his ears he draws\r\n    Even as a snail appears its horns to lose.\r\n  The tongue, which had been whole and ready was\r\n    For speech, cleaves now; the forked tongue of the snake\r\n    Joins in the other: and the smoke has pause.[665]\r\n  The soul which thus a brutish form did take,\r\n    Along the valley, hissing, swiftly fled;\r\n    The other close behind it spluttering spake,\r\n  Then, toward it turning his new shoulders, said\r\n    Unto the third: \'Now Buoso down the way                        140\r\n    May hasten crawling, as I earlier sped.\'\r\n  Ballast which in the Seventh Bolgia lay\r\n    Thus saw I shift and change. Be my excuse\r\n    The novel theme,[666] if swerves my pen astray.\r\n  And though these things mine eyesight might confuse\r\n    A little, and my mind with fear divide,\r\n    Such secrecy they fleeing could not use\r\n  But that Puccio Sciancatto plain I spied;\r\n    And he alone of the companions three\r\n    Who came at first, was left unmodified.                        150\r\n  For the other, tears, Gaville,[667] are shed by thee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[649] _The robber, etc._: By means of his prophecy Fucci has, after a\r\nfashion, taken revenge on Dante for being found by him among the\r\ncheating thieves instead of among the nobler sinners guilty of blood and\r\nviolence. But in the rage of his wounded pride he must insult even\r\nHeaven, and this he does by using the most contemptuous gesture in an\r\nItalian\'s repertory. The fig is made by thrusting the thumb between the\r\nnext two fingers. In the English \'A fig for him!\' we have a reference to\r\nthe gesture.\r\n\r\n[650] _Pistoia_: The Pistoiese bore the reputation of being hard and\r\npitiless. The tradition was that their city had been founded by such of\r\nCatiline\'s followers as survived his defeat on the Campo Piceno. \'It is\r\nno wonder,\' says Villani (i. 32) \'that, being the descendants as they\r\nare of Catiline and his followers, the Pistoiese have always been\r\nruthless and cruel to strangers and to one another.\'\r\n\r\n[651] _Who down Thebes\' wall_: Capaneus (_Inf._ xiv. 63).\r\n\r\n[652] _Maremma_: See note, _Inf._ xiii. 8.\r\n\r\n[653] _Cacus_: Dante makes him a Centaur, but Virgil (_\xc3\x86n._ viii.) only\r\ndescribes him as half human. The pool was fed with the blood of his\r\nhuman victims. The herd was the spoil Hercules took from Geryon. In the\r\n_\xc3\x86neid_ Cacus defends himself from Hercules by vomiting a fiery smoke;\r\nand this doubtless suggested the dragon of the text.\r\n\r\n[654] _His brethren_: The Centaurs who guard the river of blood (_Inf._\r\nxii. 56). In Fucci, as a sinner guilty of blood and violence above most\r\nof the thieves, the Centaur Cacus takes a special malign interest.\r\n\r\n[655] _Our tale_: Of Cacus. It is interrupted by the arrival of three\r\nsinners whom Dante does not at first recognise as he gazes down on them,\r\nbut only when they begin to speak among themselves. They are three noble\r\ncitizens of Florence: Agnello Brunelleschi, Buoso degli Abati, and\r\nPuccio Sciancatto de\' Galigai--all said to have pilfered in private\r\nlife, or to have abused their tenure of high office by plundering the\r\nCommonwealth. What is certainly known of them is that they were\r\nFlorentine thieves of quality.\r\n\r\n[656] _Cianfa_: Another Florentine gentleman, one of the Donati. Since\r\nhis companions lost sight of him he has been transformed into a\r\nsix-footed serpent. Immediately appearing, he darts upon Agnello.\r\n\r\n[657] _On chin, etc._: A gesture by which silence is requested. The\r\nmention of Cianfa shows Dante that he is among Florentines.\r\n\r\n[658] _Papyrus_: The original is _papiro_, the word used in Dante\'s time\r\nfor a wick made out of a reed like the papyrus; _pap\xc3\xa9r_ being still the\r\nname for a wick in some dialects.--(Scartazzini.) It cannot be shown\r\nthat _papiro_ was ever employed for paper in Italian. This, however,\r\ndoes not prove that Dante may not so use it in this instance, adopting\r\nit from the Latin _papyrus_. Besides, he says that the brown colour\r\ntravels up over the _papiro_; while it goes downward on a burning wick.\r\nNor would the simile, if drawn from a slowly burning lamp-wick, agree\r\nwith the speed of the change described in the text.\r\n\r\n[659] _A little snake_: As transpires from the last line of the Canto,\r\nthis is Francesco, of the Florentine family of the Cavalcanti, to which\r\nDante\'s friend Guido belonged. He wounds Buoso in the navel, and then,\r\ninstead of growing into one new monster as was the case with Cianfa and\r\nAgnello, they exchange shapes, and when the transformation is complete\r\nBuoso is the serpent and Francesco is the human shade.\r\n\r\n[660] _Rooted he stood, etc._: The description agrees with the symptoms\r\nof snake-bite, one of which is extreme drowsiness.\r\n\r\n[661] _Sabellus and Nassidius_: Were soldiers of Cato\'s army whose death\r\nby snake-bite in the Libyan desert is described by Lucan, _Pharsal._ ix.\r\nSabbellus was burned up by the poison, bones and all; Nassidius swelled\r\nup and burst.\r\n\r\n[662] _Cadmus_: _Metam._ iv.\r\n\r\n[663] _Arethusa_: _Metam._ v.\r\n\r\n[664] _The forms, etc._: The word _form_ is here to be taken in its\r\nscholastic sense of _virtus formativa_, the inherited power of modifying\r\nmatter into an organised body. \'This, united to the divinely implanted\r\nspark of reason,\' says Philalethes, \'constitutes, on Dante\'s system, a\r\nhuman soul. Even after death this power continues to be an essential\r\nconstituent of the soul, and constructs out of the elements what seems\r\nto be a body. Here the sinners exchange the matter they have thus made\r\ntheir own, each retaining, however, his proper plastic energy as part of\r\nhis soul.\' Dante in his _Convito_ (iii. 2) says that \'the human soul is\r\nthe noblest form of all that are made under the heavens, receiving more\r\nof the Divine nature than any other.\'\r\n\r\n[665] _The smoke has pause_: The sinners have robbed one another of all\r\nthey can lose. In the punishment is mirrored the sin that plunged them\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[666] _The novel theme_: He has lingered longer than usual on this\r\nBolgia, and pleads wonder of what he saw in excuse either of his\r\nprolixity or of some of the details of his description. The expression\r\nis perhaps one of feigned humility, to balance his recent boast of\r\nexcelling Ovid and Lucan in inventive power.\r\n\r\n[667] _Gaville_: The other, and the only one of those five Florentine\r\nthieves not yet named in the text, is he who came at first in the form\r\nof a little black snake, and who has now assumed the shape of Buoso. In\r\nreality he is Francesco Cavalcanti, who was slain by the people of\r\nGaville in the upper Valdarno. Many of them were in their turn\r\nslaughtered in revenge by the Cavalcanti and their associates. It should\r\nbe remarked that some of these five Florentines were of one party, some\r\nof the other. It is also noteworthy that Dante recruits his thieves as\r\nhe did his usurers from the great Florentine families.--As the \'shifting\r\nand changing\' of this rubbish is apt to be found confusing, the\r\nfollowing may be useful to some readers:--There first came on the scene\r\nAgnello, Buoso, and Puccio. Cianfa, in the shape of a six-footed\r\nserpent, comes and throws himself on Agnello, and then, grown\r\nincorporate in a new strange monster, two in one, they disappear. Buoso\r\nis next wounded by Francesco, and they exchange members and bodies. Only\r\nPuccio remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rejoice, O Florence, in thy widening fame!\r\n    Thy wings thou beatest over land and sea,\r\n    And even through Inferno spreads thy name.\r\n  Burghers of thine, five such were found by me\r\n    Among the thieves; whence I ashamed[668] grew,\r\n    Nor shall great glory thence redound to thee.\r\n  But if \'tis toward the morning[669] dreams are true,\r\n    Thou shalt experience ere long time be gone\r\n    The doom even Prato[670] prays for as thy due.\r\n  And came it now, it would not come too soon.                      10\r\n    Would it were come as come it must with time:\r\n    \'Twill crush me more the older I am grown.\r\n  Departing thence, my Guide began to climb\r\n    The jutting rocks by which we made descent\r\n    Some while ago,[671] and pulled me after him.\r\n  And as upon our lonely way we went\r\n    \'Mong splinters[672] of the cliff, the feet in vain,\r\n    Without the hand to help, had labour spent.\r\n  I sorrowed, and am sorrow-smit again,\r\n    Recalling what before mine eyes there lay,                      20\r\n    And, more than I am wont, my genius rein\r\n  From running save where virtue leads the way;\r\n    So that if happy star[673] or holier might\r\n    Have gifted me I never mourn it may.\r\n  At time of year when he who gives earth light\r\n    His face shows to us longest visible,\r\n    When gnats replace the fly at fall of night,\r\n  Not by the peasant resting on the hill\r\n    Are seen more fire-flies in the vale below,\r\n    Where he perchance doth field and vineyard[674] till,           30\r\n  Than flamelets I beheld resplendent glow\r\n    Throughout the whole Eighth Bolgia, when at last\r\n    I stood whence I the bottom plain could know.\r\n  And as he whom the bears avenged, when passed\r\n    From the earth Elijah, saw the chariot rise\r\n    With horses heavenward reared and mounting fast,\r\n  And no long time had traced it with his eyes\r\n    Till but a flash of light it all became,\r\n    Which like a rack of cloud swept to the skies:\r\n  Deep in the valley\'s gorge, in mode the same,                     40\r\n    These flitted; what it held by none was shown,\r\n    And yet a sinner[675] lurked in every flame.\r\n  To see them well I from the bridge peered down,\r\n    And if a jutting crag I had not caught\r\n    I must have fallen, though neither thrust nor thrown.\r\n  My Leader me beholding lost in thought:\r\n    \'In all the fires are spirits,\' said to me;\r\n    \'His flame round each is for a garment wrought.\'\r\n  \'O Master!\' I replied, \'by hearing thee\r\n    I grow assured, but yet I knew before                           50\r\n    That thus indeed it was, and longed to be\r\n  Told who is in the flame which there doth soar,\r\n    Cloven, as if ascending from the pyre\r\n    Where with Eteocles[676] there burned of yore\r\n  His brother.\' He: \'Ulysses in that fire\r\n    And Diomedes[677] burn; in punishment\r\n    Thus held together, as they held in ire.\r\n  And, wrapped within their flame, they now repent\r\n    The ambush of the horse, which oped the door\r\n    Through which the Romans\' noble seed[678] forth went.           60\r\n  For guile De\xc3\xafdamia[679] makes deplore\r\n    In death her lost Achilles, tears they shed,\r\n    And bear for the Palladium[680] vengeance sore.\'\r\n  \'Master, I pray thee fervently,\' I said,\r\n    \'If from those flames they still can utter speech--\r\n    Give ear as if a thousand times I pled!\r\n  Refuse not here to linger, I beseech,\r\n    Until the cloven fire shall hither gain:\r\n    Thou seest how toward it eagerly I reach.\'\r\n  And he: \'Thy prayers are worthy to obtain                         70\r\n    Exceeding praise; thou hast what thou dost seek:\r\n    But see that thou from speech thy tongue refrain.\r\n  I know what thou wouldst have; leave me to speak,\r\n    For they perchance would hear contemptuously\r\n    Shouldst thou address them, seeing they were Greek.\'[681]\r\n  Soon as the flame toward us had come so nigh\r\n    That to my Leader time and place seemed met,\r\n    I heard him thus adjure it to reply:\r\n  \'O ye who twain within one fire are set,\r\n    If what I did your guerdon meriteth,                            80\r\n    If much or little ye are in my debt\r\n  For the great verse I built while I had breath,\r\n    By one of you be openly confessed\r\n    Where, lost to men, at last he met with death.\'\r\n  Of the ancient flame the more conspicuous crest\r\n    Murmuring began to waver up and down\r\n    Like flame that flickers, by the wind distressed.\r\n  At length by it was measured motion shown,\r\n    Like tongue that moves in speech; and by the flame\r\n    Was language uttered thus: \'When I had gone                     90\r\n  From Circe[682] who a long year kept me tame\r\n    Beside her, ere the near Gaeta had\r\n    Receiv\xc3\xa8d from \xc3\x86neas that new name;\r\n  No softness for my son, nor reverence sad\r\n    For my old father, nor the love I owed\r\n    Penelope with which to make her glad,\r\n  Could quench the ardour that within me glowed\r\n    A full experience of the world to gain--\r\n    Of human vice and worth. But I abroad\r\n  Launched out upon the high and open main[683]                    100\r\n    With but one bark and but the little band\r\n    Which ne\'er deserted me.[684] As far as Spain\r\n  I saw the sea-shore upon either hand,\r\n    And as Morocco; saw Sardinia\'s isle,\r\n    And all of which those waters wash the strand.\r\n  I and my comrades were grown old the while\r\n    And sluggish, ere we to the narrows came\r\n    Where Hercules of old did landmarks pile\r\n  For sign to men they should no further aim;\r\n    And Seville lay behind me on the right,                        110\r\n    As on the left lay Ceuta. Then to them\r\n  I spake: "O Brothers, who through such a fight\r\n    Of hundred thousand dangers West have won,\r\n    In this short watch that ushers in the night\r\n  Of all your senses, ere your day be done,\r\n    Refuse not to obtain experience new\r\n    Of worlds unpeopled, yonder, past the sun.\r\n  Consider whence the seed of life ye drew;\r\n    Ye were not born to live like brutish herd,\r\n    But righteousness and wisdom to ensue."                        120\r\n  My comrades to such eagerness were stirred\r\n    By this short speech the course to enter on,\r\n    They had no longer brooked restraining word.\r\n  Turning our poop to where the morning shone\r\n    We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,\r\n    Still tending left the further we had gone.\r\n  And of the other pole I saw at night\r\n    Now all the stars; and \'neath the watery plain\r\n    Our own familiar heavens were lost to sight.\r\n  Five times afresh had kindled, and again                         130\r\n    The moon\'s face earthward was illumed no more,\r\n    Since out we sailed upon the mighty main;[685]\r\n  Then we beheld a lofty mountain[686] soar,\r\n    Dim in the distance; higher, as I thought,\r\n    By far than any I had seen before.\r\n  We joyed; but with despair were soon distraught\r\n    When burst a whirlwind from the new-found world\r\n    And the forequarter of the vessel caught.\r\n  With all the waters thrice it round was swirled;\r\n    At the fourth time the poop, heaved upward, rose,              140\r\n    The prow, as pleased Another,[687] down was hurled;\r\n  And then above us did the ocean close.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[668] _Whence I ashamed, etc._: There is here a sudden change from irony\r\nto earnest. \'Five members of great Florentine families, eternally\r\nengaged among themselves in their shameful metamorphoses--nay, but it is\r\ntoo sad!\'\r\n\r\n[669] _Toward the morning, etc._: There was a widespread belief in the\r\ngreater truthfulness of dreams dreamed as the night wears away. See\r\n_Purg._ ix. 13. The dream is Dante\'s foreboding of what is to happen to\r\nFlorence. Of its truth he has no doubt, and the only question is how\r\nsoon will it be answered by the fact. Soon, he says, if it is near to\r\nthe morning that we dream true dreams--morning being the season of\r\nwaking reality in which dreams are accomplished.\r\n\r\n[670] _Even Prato_: A small neighbouring city, much under the influence\r\nof Florence, and somewhat oppressed by it. The commentators reckon up\r\nthe disasters that afflicted Florence in the first years of the\r\nfourteenth century, between the date of Dante\'s journey and the time he\r\nwrote--fires, falls of bridges, and civil strife. But such misfortunes\r\nwere too much in keeping with the usual course of Florentine history to\r\nmove Dante thus deeply in the retrospect; and as he speaks here in his\r\nown person the \'soon\' is more naturally counted from the time at which\r\nhe writes than from the date assigned by him to his pilgrimage. He is\r\nlooking forward to the period when his own return in triumph to Florence\r\nwas to be prepared by grievous national reverses; and, as a patriot, he\r\nfeels that he cannot be wholly reconciled by his private advantage to\r\nthe public misfortune. But it was all only a dream.\r\n\r\n[671] _Some while ago_: See note, _Inf._ xxiv. 79.\r\n\r\n[672] _\'Mong splinters, etc._: They cross the wall or barrier between\r\nthe Seventh and Eighth Bolgias. From _Inf._ xxiv. 63 we have learned\r\nthat the rib of rock, on the line of which they are now proceeding, with\r\nits arches which overhang the various Bolgias, is rougher and worse to\r\nfollow than that by which they began their passage towards the centre of\r\nMalebolge.\r\n\r\n[673] _Happy star_: See note, _Inf._ xv. 55. Dante seems to have been\r\nuncertain what credence to give to the claims of astrology. In a passage\r\nof the _Purgatorio_ (xvi. 67) he tries to establish that whatever\r\ninfluence the stars may possess over us we can never, except with our\r\nown consent, be influenced by them to evil.--His sorrow here, as\r\nelsewhere, is not wholly a feeling of pity for the suffering shades, but\r\nis largely mingled with misgivings for himself. The punishment of those\r\nto whose sins he feels no inclination he always beholds with equanimity.\r\nHere, as he looks down upon the false counsellors and considers what\r\ntemptations there are to misapply intellectual gifts, he is smitten with\r\ndread lest his lot should one day be cast in that dismal valley and he\r\nfind cause to regret that the talent of genius was ever committed to\r\nhim. The memory even of what he saw makes him recollect himself and\r\nresolve to be wary. Then, as if to justify the claim to superior powers\r\nthus clearly implied, there comes a passage which in the original is of\r\nuncommon beauty.\r\n\r\n[674] _Field and vineyard_: These lines, redolent of the sweet Tuscan\r\nmidsummer gloaming, give us amid the horrors of Malebolge something like\r\nthe breath of fresh air the peasant lingers to enjoy. It may be noted\r\nthat in Italy the village is often found perched above the more fertile\r\nland, on a site originally chosen with a view to security from attack.\r\nSo that here the peasant is at home from his labour.\r\n\r\n[675] _And yet a sinner, etc._: The false counsellors who for selfish\r\nends hid their true minds and misused their intellectual light to lead\r\nothers astray are for ever hidden each in his own wandering flame.\r\n\r\n[676] _Eteocles_: Son of Oedipus and twin brother of Polynices. The\r\nbrothers slew one another, and were placed on the same funeral pile, the\r\nflame of which clove into two as if to image the discord that had\r\nexisted between them (_Theb._ xii.).\r\n\r\n[677] _And Diomedes_: The two are associated in deeds of blood and guile\r\nat the siege of Troy.\r\n\r\n[678] _The Romans\' noble seed_: The trick of the wooden horse led to the\r\ncapture of Troy, and that led \xc3\x86neas to wander forth on the adventures\r\nthat ended in the settlement of the Trojans in Italy.\r\n\r\n[679] _De\xc3\xafdamia_: That Achilles might be kept from joining the Greek\r\nexpedition to Troy he was sent by his mother to the court of Lycomedes,\r\nfather of De\xc3\xafdamia. Ulysses lured him away from his hiding-place and\r\nfrom De\xc3\xafdamia, whom he had made a mother.\r\n\r\n[680] _The Palladium_: The Trojan sacred image of Pallas, stolen by\r\nUlysses and Diomed (_\xc3\x86n._ ii.). Ulysses is here upon his own ground.\r\n\r\n[681] _They were Greek_: Some find here an allusion to Dante\'s ignorance\r\nof the Greek language and literature. But Virgil addresses them in the\r\nLombard dialect of Italian (_Inf._ xxvii. 21). He acts as spokesman\r\nbecause those ancient Greeks were all so haughty that to a common modern\r\nmortal they would have nothing to say. He, as the author of the _\xc3\x86neid_,\r\nhas a special claim on their good-nature. It is but seldom that the\r\nshades are told who Virgil is, and never directly. Here Ulysses may\r\ninfer it from the mention of the \'lofty verse.\'\r\n\r\n[682] _From Circe_: It is Ulysses that speaks.\r\n\r\n[683] _The open main_: The Mediterranean as distinguished from the\r\n\xc3\x86gean.\r\n\r\n[684] _Which ne\'er deserted me_: There seems no reason for supposing,\r\nwith Philalethes, that Ulysses is here represented as sailing on his\r\nlast voyage from the island of Circe and not from Ithaca. Ulysses, on\r\nthe contrary, represents himself as breaking away afresh from all the\r\nties of home. According to Homer, Ulysses had lost all his companions\r\nere he returned to Ithaca; and in the _Odyssey_ Tiresias prophesies to\r\nhim that his last wanderings are to be inland. But any acquaintance that\r\nDante had with Homer can only have been vague and fragmentary. He may\r\nhave founded his narrative of how Ulysses ended his days upon some\r\nfloating legend; or, eager to fill up what he took to be a blank in the\r\nworld of imagination, he may have drawn wholly on his own creative\r\npower. In any case it is his Ulysses who, through the version of him\r\ngiven by a living poet, is most familiar to the English reader.\r\n\r\n[685] _The mighty main_: The Atlantic Ocean. They bear to the left as\r\nthey sail, till their course is due south, and crossing the Equator,\r\nthey find themselves under the strange skies of the southern hemisphere.\r\nFor months they have seen no land.\r\n\r\n[686] _A lofty mountain_: This is the Mountain of Purgatory, according\r\nto Dante\'s geography antipodal to Jerusalem, and the only land in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[687] _As pleased Another_: Ulysses is proudly resigned to the failure\r\nof his enterprise, \'for he was Greek.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now, having first erect and silent grown\r\n    (For it would say no more), from us the flame,\r\n    The Poet sweet consenting,[688] had moved on;\r\n  And then our eyes were turned to one that came[689]\r\n    Behind it on the way, by sounds that burst\r\n    Out of its crest in a confus\xc3\xa8d stream.\r\n  As the Sicilian bull,[690] which bellowed first\r\n    With his lamenting--and it was but right--\r\n    Who had prepared it with his tools accurst,[691]\r\n  Roared with the howlings of the tortured wight,                   10\r\n    So that although constructed all of brass\r\n    Yet seemed it pierced with anguish to the height;\r\n  So, wanting road and vent by which to pass\r\n    Up through the flame, into the flame\'s own speech\r\n    The woeful language all converted was.\r\n  But when the words at length contrived to reach\r\n    The top, while hither thither shook the crest\r\n    As moved the tongue[692] at utterance of each,\r\n  We heard: \'Oh thou, to whom are now addressed\r\n    My words, who spakest now in Lombard phrase:                    20\r\n    "Depart;[693] of thee I nothing more request."\r\n  Though I be late arrived, yet of thy grace\r\n    Let it not irk thee here a while to stay:\r\n    It irks not me, yet, as thou seest, I blaze.\r\n  If lately to this world devoid of day\r\n    From that sweet Latian land thou art come down\r\n    Whence all my guilt I bring, declare and say\r\n  Has now Romagna peace? because my own\r\n    Native abode was in the mountain land\r\n    \'Tween springs[694] of Tiber and Urbino town.\'                  30\r\n  While I intent and bending low did stand,\r\n    My Leader, as he touched me on the side,\r\n    \'Speak thou, for he is Latian,\' gave command.\r\n  Whereon without delay I thus replied--\r\n    Because already[695] was my speech prepared:\r\n    \'Soul, that down there dost in concealment \'bide,\r\n  In thy Romagna[696] wars have never spared\r\n    And spare not now in tyrants\' hearts to rage;\r\n    But when I left it there was none declared.\r\n  No change has fallen Ravenna[697] for an age.                     40\r\n    There, covering Cervia too with outspread wing,\r\n    Polenta\'s Eagle guards his heritage.\r\n  Over the city[698] which long suffering\r\n    Endured, and Frenchmen slain on Frenchmen rolled,\r\n    The Green Paws[699] once again protection fling.\r\n  The Mastiffs of Verrucchio,[700] young and old,\r\n    Who to Montagna[701] brought such evil cheer,\r\n    Still clinch their fangs where they were wont to hold.\r\n  Cities,[702] Lamone and Santerno near,\r\n    The Lion couched in white are governed by                       50\r\n    Which changes party with the changing year.\r\n  And that to which the Savio[703] wanders nigh\r\n    As it is set \'twixt mountain and champaign\r\n    Lives now in freedom now \'neath tyranny.\r\n  But who thou art I to be told am fain:\r\n    Be not more stubborn than we others found,\r\n    As thou on earth illustrious wouldst remain.\'\r\n  When first the fire a little while had moaned\r\n    After its manner, next the pointed crest\r\n    Waved to and fro; then in this sense breathed sound:\r\n  \'If I believed my answer were addressed                           61\r\n    To one that earthward shall his course retrace,\r\n    This flame should forthwith altogether rest.\r\n  But since[704] none ever yet out of this place\r\n    Returned alive, if all be true I hear,\r\n    I yield thee answer fearless of disgrace.\r\n  I was a warrior, then a Cordelier;[705]\r\n    Thinking thus girt to purge away my stain:\r\n    And sure my hope had met with answer clear\r\n  Had not the High Priest[706]--ill with him remain!                70\r\n    Plunged me anew into my former sin:\r\n    And why and how, I would to thee make plain.\r\n  While I the frame of bones and flesh was in\r\n    My mother gave me, all the deeds I wrought\r\n    Were fox-like and in no wise leonine.\r\n  Of every wile and hidden way I caught\r\n    The secret trick, and used them with such sleight\r\n    That all the world with fame of it was fraught.\r\n  When I perceived I had attain\xc3\xa8d quite\r\n    The time of life when it behoves each one                       80\r\n    To furl his sails and coil his cordage tight,\r\n  Sorrowing for deeds I had with pleasure done,\r\n    Contrite and shriven, I religious grew.\r\n    Ah, wretched me! and well it was begun\r\n  But for the Chieftain of the Pharisees new,[707]\r\n    Then waging war hard by the Lateran,\r\n    And not with Saracen nor yet with Jew;\r\n  For Christian[708] were his enemies every man,\r\n    And none had at the siege of Acre been\r\n    Or trafficked in the Empire of Sold\xc3\xa0n.                          90\r\n  His lofty office he held cheap, and e\'en\r\n    His Sacred Orders and the cord I wore,\r\n    Which used[709] to make the wearers of it lean.\r\n  As from Soracte[710] Constantine of yore\r\n    Sylvester called to cure his leprosy,\r\n    I as a leech was called this man before\r\n  To cure him of his fever which ran high;\r\n    My counsel he required, but I stood dumb,\r\n    For drunken all his words appeared to be.\r\n  He said; "For fear be in thy heart no room;                      100\r\n    Beforehand I absolve thee, but declare\r\n    How Palestrina I may overcome.\r\n  Heaven I unlock, as thou art well aware,\r\n    And close at will; because the keys are twin\r\n    My predecessor[711] was averse to bear."\r\n  Then did his weighty reasoning on me win\r\n    Till to be silent seemed the worst of all;\r\n    And, "Father," I replied, "since from this sin\r\n  Thou dost absolve me into which I fall--\r\n    The scant performance[712] of a promise wide                   110\r\n    Will yield thee triumph in thy lofty stall."\r\n  Francis came for me soon as e\'er I died;\r\n    But one of the black Cherubim was there\r\n    And "Take him not, nor rob me of him" cried,\r\n  "For him of right among my thralls I bear\r\n    Because he offered counsel fraudulent;\r\n    Since when I\'ve had him firmly by the hair.\r\n  None is absolved unless he first repent;\r\n    Nor can repentance house with purpose ill,\r\n    For this the contradiction doth prevent."                      120\r\n  Ah, wretched me! How did I shrinking thrill\r\n    When clutching me he sneered: "Perhaps of old\r\n    Thou didst not think[713] I had in logic skill."\r\n  He carried me to Minos:[714] Minos rolled\r\n    His tail eight times round his hard back; in ire\r\n    Biting it fiercely, ere of me he told:\r\n  "Among the sinners of the shrouding fire!"\r\n    Therefore am I, where thou beholdest, lost;\r\n    And, sore at heart, go clothed in such attire.\'\r\n  What he would say thus ended by the ghost,                       130\r\n    Away from us the moaning flame did glide\r\n    While to and fro its pointed horn was tossed.\r\n  But we passed further on, I and my Guide,\r\n    Along the cliff to where the arch is set\r\n    O\'er the next moat, where paying they reside,\r\n  As schismatics who whelmed themselves in debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[688] _Consenting_: See line 21.\r\n\r\n[689] _One that came_: This is the fire-enveloped shade of Guido of\r\nMontefeltro, the colloquy with whom occupies the whole of the Canto.\r\n\r\n[690] _The Sicilian bull_: Perillus, an Athenian, presented Phalaris,\r\nthe tyrant of Agrigentum, with a brazen bull so constructed that when it\r\nwas heated from below the cries of the victim it contained were\r\nconverted into the bellowing of a bull. The first trial of the invention\r\nwas made upon the artist.\r\n\r\n[691] _Accurst_: Not in the original. \'Rime in English hath such\r\nscarcity,\' as Chaucer says.\r\n\r\n[692] _As moved the tongue, etc._: The shade being enclosed in the\r\nhollow fire all his words are changed into a sound like the roaring of a\r\nflame. At last, when an opening has been worked through the crested\r\npoint, the speech becomes articulate.\r\n\r\n[693] _Depart, etc._: One at least of the words quoted as having been\r\nused by Virgil is Lombard. There is something very quaint in making him\r\nuse the Lombard dialect of Dante\'s time.\r\n\r\n[694] _\'Tween springs, etc._: Montefeltro lies between Urbino and the\r\nmountain where the Tiber has its source.\r\n\r\n[695] _Already_: Dante knew that Virgil would refer to him for an answer\r\nto Guido\'s question, bearing as it did on modern Italian affairs.\r\n\r\n[696] _Romagna_: The district of Italy lying on the Adriatic, south of\r\nthe Po and east of Tuscany, of which Bologna and the cities named in the\r\ntext were the principal towns. During the last quarter of the thirteenth\r\ncentury it was the scene of constant wars promoted in the interest of\r\nthe Church, which claimed Romagna as the gift of the Emperor Rudolf, and\r\nin that of the great nobles of the district, who while using the Guelf\r\nand Ghibeline war-cries aimed at nothing but the lordship of the various\r\ncities. Foremost among these nobles was he with whose shade Dante\r\nspeaks. Villani calls him \'the most sagacious and accomplished warrior\r\nof his time in Italy\' (_Cronica_, vii. 80). He was possessed of lands of\r\nhis own near Forl\xc3\xac and Cesena, and was lord in turn of many of the\r\nRomagnese cities. On the whole he appears to have remained true to his\r\nGhibeline colours in spite of Papal fulminations, although once and\r\nagain he was reconciled to the Church; on the last occasion in 1294. In\r\nthe years immediately before this he had greatly distinguished himself\r\nas a wise governor and able general in the service of the Ghibeline\r\nPisa--or rather as the paid lord of it.\r\n\r\n[697] _Ravenna_: Ravenna and the neighbouring town of Cervia were in\r\n1300 under the lordship of members of the Polenta family--the father and\r\nbrothers of the ill-fated Francesca (_Inf._ v.). Their arms were an\r\neagle, half white on an azure and half red on a gold field. It was in\r\nthe court of the generous Guido, son of one of these brothers, that\r\nDante was to find his last refuge and to die.\r\n\r\n[698] _Over the city, etc._: Forl\xc3\xac. The reference is to one of the most\r\nbrilliant feats of war performed by Guido of Montefeltro. Frenchmen\r\nformed great part of an army sent in 1282 against Forl\xc3\xac by the Pope,\r\nMartin IV., himself a Frenchman. Guido, then lord of the city, led them\r\ninto a trap and overthrew them with great slaughter. Like most men of\r\nhis time Guido was a believer in astrology, and is said on this occasion\r\nto have acted on the counsel of Guido Bonatti, mentioned among the\r\ndiviners in the Fourth Bolgia (_Inf._ xx. 118).\r\n\r\n[699] _The Green Paws_: In 1300 the Ordelaffi were lords of Forl\xc3\xac. Their\r\narms were a green lion on a gold ground. During the first years of his\r\nexile Dante had to do with Scarpetta degli Ordelaffi, under whose\r\ncommand the exiled Florentines put themselves for a time, and there is\r\neven a tradition that he acted as his secretary.\r\n\r\n[700] _The Mastiffs of Verrucchio_: Verrucchio was the castle of the\r\nMalatestas, lords of Rimini, called the Mastiffs on account of their\r\ncruel tenacity. The elder was the father of Francesca\'s husband and\r\nlover; the younger was a brother of these.\r\n\r\n[701] _Montagna_: Montagna de\' Parcitati, one of a Ghibeline family that\r\ncontested superiority in Rimini with the Guelf Malatestas, was taken\r\nprisoner by guile and committed by the old Mastiff to the keeping of the\r\nyoung one, whose fangs were set in him to such purpose that he soon died\r\nin his dungeon.\r\n\r\n[702] _Cities, etc._: Imola and Faenza, situated on the rivers named in\r\nthe text. Mainardo Pagani, lord of these towns, had for arms an azure\r\nlion on a white field. During his minority he was a ward of the\r\nCommonwealth of Florence. By his cunning and daring he earned the name\r\nof the Demon (_Purg._ xiv. 118). He died at Imola in 1302, and was\r\nburied in the garb of a monk of Vallombrosa. Like most of his neighbours\r\nhe changed his party as often as his interest required. He was a Guelf\r\nin Florence and a Ghibeline in Romagna, say some.\r\n\r\n[703] _Savio_: Cesena, on the Savio, was distinguished among the cities\r\nof Romagna by being left more frequently than the others were to manage\r\nits own affairs. The Malatestas and Montefeltros were in turn possessed\r\nof the tyranny of it.\r\n\r\n[704] _But since, etc._: The shades, being enveloped in fire, are unable\r\nto see those with whom they speak; and so Guido does not detect in Dante\r\nthe signs of a living man, but takes him to be like himself a denizen of\r\nInferno. He would not have the truth regarding his fate to be known in\r\nthe world, where he is supposed to have departed life in the odour of\r\nsanctity. Dante\'s promise to refresh his fame he either regards as\r\nmeaningless, or as one made without the power of fulfilling it. Dante\r\nleaves him in his error, for he is there to learn all he can, and not to\r\nbandy personal confessions with the shades.\r\n\r\n[705] _A Cordelier_: In 1296 Guido entered the Franciscan Order. He died\r\nin 1298, but where is not known; some authorities say at Venice and\r\nothers at Assisi. Benvenuto tells: \'He was often seen begging his bread\r\nin Ancona, where he was buried. Many good deeds are related of him, and\r\nI cherish a sweet hope that he may have been saved.\'\r\n\r\n[706] _The High Priest_: Boniface VIII.\r\n\r\n[707] _The Pharisees new_: The members of the Court of Rome. Saint\r\nJerome calls the dignified Roman clergy of his day \'the Senate of the\r\nPharisees.\'\r\n\r\n[708] _For Christian, etc._: The foes of Boniface, here spoken of, were\r\nthe Cardinals Peter and James Colonna. He destroyed their palace in Rome\r\n(1297) and carried the war against them to their country seat at\r\nPalestrina, the ancient Pr\xc3\xa6neste, then a great stronghold. Dante here\r\nbitterly blames Boniface for instituting a crusade against Christians at\r\na time when, by the recent loss of Acre, the gate of the Holy Land had\r\nbeen lost to Christendom. The Colonnas were innocent, too, of the crime\r\nof supplying the Infidel with munitions of war--a crime condemned by the\r\nLateran Council of 1215, and by Boniface himself, who excluded those\r\nguilty of it from the benefits of the great Jubilee of 1300.\r\n\r\n[709] _Which used, etc._: In former times, when the rule of the Order\r\nwas faithfully observed. Dante charges the Franciscans with degeneracy\r\nin the _Paradiso_, xi. 124.\r\n\r\n[710] _From Soracte_: Referring to the well-known legend. The fee for\r\nthe cure was the fabulous Donation. See _Inf._ xix. 115.\r\n\r\n[711] _My predecessor_: Celestine v. See _Inf._ iii. 60.\r\n\r\n[712] _The scant performance, etc._: That Guido gave such counsel is\r\nrelated by a contemporary chronicler: \'The Pope said: Tell me how to get\r\nthe better of those mine enemies, thou who art so knowing in these\r\nthings. Then he answered: Promise much, and perform little; which he\r\ndid.\' But it seems odd that the wily and unscrupulous Boniface should\r\nhave needed to put himself to school for such a simple lesson.\r\n\r\n[713] _Thou didst not think, etc._: Guido had forgot that others could\r\nreason besides the Pope. With regard to the inefficacy of the Papal\r\nabsolution an old commentator says, following Origen: \'The Popes that\r\nwalk in the footsteps of Peter have this power of binding and loosing;\r\nbut only such as do so walk.\' But on Dante\'s scheme of what fixes the\r\nfate of the soul absolution matters little to save, or priestly curses\r\nto damnify. See _Purg._ iii. 133. It is unfeigned repentance that can\r\nhelp a sinner even at the last; and it is remarkable that in the case of\r\nBuonconte, the gallant son of this same Guido, the infernal angel who\r\ncomes for him as he expires complains that he has been cheated of his\r\nvictim by one poor tear. See _Purg._ v. 88, etc. Why then is no\r\nindulgence shown in Dante\'s court to Guido, who might well have been\r\nplaced in Purgatory and made to have repented effectually of this his\r\nlast sin? That Dante had any personal grudge against him we can hardly\r\nthink. In the Fourth Book of the _Convito_ (written, according to\r\nFraticelli, in 1297), he calls him \'our most noble Guido Montefeltrano;\'\r\nand praises him as one of the wise and noble souls that refuse to run\r\nwith full sails into the port of death, but furl the sails of their\r\nworldly undertakings, and, relinquishing all earthly pleasures and\r\nbusiness, give themselves up in their old age to a religious life.\r\nEither, then, he sets Guido here in order that he may have a modern\r\nfalse counsellor worthy to be ranked with Ulysses; or because, on longer\r\nexperience, he had come to reprobate more keenly the abuse of the\r\nFranciscan habit; or, most likely of all, that he might, even at the\r\ncost of Guido, load the hated memory of Boniface with another reproach.\r\n\r\n[714] _Minos_: Here we have Minos represented in the act of pronouncing\r\njudgment in words as well as by the figurative rolling of his tail\r\naround his body (_Inf._ v. 11).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Could any, even in words unclogged by rhyme\r\n    Recount the wounds that now I saw,[715] and blood,\r\n    Although he aimed at it time after time?\r\n  Here every tongue must fail of what it would,\r\n    Because our human speech and powers of thought\r\n    To grasp so much come short in aptitude.\r\n  If all the people were together brought\r\n    Who in Apulia,[716] land distressed by fate,\r\n    Made lamentation for the bloodshed wrought\r\n  By Rome;[717] and in that war procrastinate[718]                  10\r\n    When the large booty of the rings was won,\r\n    As Livy writes whose every word has weight;\r\n  With those on whom such direful deeds were done\r\n    When Robert Guiscard[719] they as foes assailed;\r\n    And those of whom still turns up many a bone\r\n  At Ceperan,[720] where each Apulian failed\r\n    In faith; and those at Tagliacozzo[721] strewed,\r\n    Where old Alardo, not by arms, prevailed;\r\n  And each his wounds and mutilations showed,\r\n    Yet would they far behind by those be left                      20\r\n    Who had the vile Ninth Bolgia for abode.\r\n  No cask, of middle stave or end bereft,\r\n    E\'er gaped like one I saw the rest among,\r\n    Slit from the chin all downward to the cleft.\r\n  Between his legs his entrails drooping hung;\r\n    The pluck and that foul bag were evident\r\n    Which changes what is swallowed into dung.\r\n  And while I gazed upon him all intent,\r\n    Opening his breast his eyes on me he set,\r\n    Saying: \'Behold, how by myself I\'m rent!                        30\r\n  See how dismembered now is Mahomet![722]\r\n    Ali[723] in front of me goes weeping too;\r\n    With visage from the chin to forelock split.\r\n  By all the others whom thou seest there grew\r\n    Scandal and schism while yet they breathed the day;\r\n    Because of which they now are cloven through.\r\n  There stands behind a devil on the way,\r\n    Us with his sword thus cruelly to trim:\r\n    He cleaves again each of our company\r\n  As soon as we complete the circuit grim;                          40\r\n    Because the wounds of each are healed outright\r\n    Or e\'er anew he goes in front of him.\r\n  But who art thou that peerest from the height,\r\n    It may be putting off to reach the pain\r\n    Which shall the crimes confessed by thee requite?\'\r\n  \'Death has not seized him yet, nor is he ta\'en\r\n    To torment for his sins,\' my Master said;\r\n    \'But, that he may a full experience gain,\r\n  By me, a ghost, \'tis doomed he should be led\r\n    Down the Infernal circles, round on round;                      50\r\n    And what I tell thee is the truth indeed.\'\r\n  A hundred shades and more, to whom the sound\r\n    Had reached, stood in the moat to mark me well,\r\n    Their pangs forgot; so did the words astound.\r\n  \'Let Fra Dolcin[724] provide, thou mayst him tell--\r\n    Thou, who perchance ere long shalt sunward go--\r\n    Unless he soon would join me in this Hell,\r\n  Much food, lest aided by the siege of snow\r\n    The Novarese should o\'er him victory get,\r\n    Which otherwise to win they would be slow.\'                     60\r\n  While this was said to me by Mahomet\r\n    One foot he held uplifted; to the ground\r\n    He let it fall, and so he forward set\r\n  Next, one whose throat was gaping with a wound,\r\n    Whose nose up to the brows away was sheared\r\n    And on whose head a single ear was found,\r\n  At me, with all the others, wondering peered;\r\n    And, ere the rest, an open windpipe made,\r\n    The outside of it all with crimson smeared.\r\n  \'O thou, not here because of guilt,\' he said;                     70\r\n    \'And whom I sure on Latian ground did know\r\n    Unless by strong similitude betrayed,\r\n  Upon Pier da Medicin[725] bestow\r\n    A thought, shouldst thou revisit the sweet plain\r\n    That from Vercelli[726] slopes to Marcab\xc3\xb2.\r\n  And make thou known to Fano\'s worthiest twain--\r\n    To Messer Guido and to Angiolel--\r\n    They, unless foresight here be wholly vain,\r\n  Thrown overboard in gyve and manacle\r\n    Shall drown fast by Cattolica, as planned                       80\r\n    By treachery of a tyrant fierce and fell.\r\n  Between Majolica[727] and Cyprus strand\r\n    A blacker crime did Neptune never spy\r\n    By pirates wrought, or even by Argives\' hand.\r\n  The traitor[728] who is blinded of an eye,\r\n    Lord of the town which of my comrades one\r\n    Had been far happier ne\'er to have come nigh,\r\n  To parley with him will allure them on,\r\n    Then so provide, against Focara\'s[729] blast\r\n    No need for them of vow or orison.\'                             90\r\n  And I: \'Point out and tell, if wish thou hast\r\n    To get news of thee to the world conveyed,\r\n    Who rues that e\'er his eyes thereon were cast?\'\r\n  On a companion\'s jaw his hand he laid,\r\n    And shouted, while the mouth he open prised:\r\n    \'\'Tis this one here by whom no word is said.\r\n  He quenched all doubt in C\xc3\xa6sar, and advised--\r\n    Himself an outlaw--that a man equipped\r\n    For strife ran danger if he temporised.\'\r\n  Alas, to look on, how downcast and hipped                        100\r\n    Curio,[730] once bold in counsel, now appeared;\r\n    With gorge whence by the roots the tongue was ripped.\r\n  Another one, whose hands away were sheared,\r\n    In the dim air his stumps uplifted high\r\n    So that his visage was with blood besmeared,\r\n  And, \'Mosca,[731] too, remember!\' loud did cry,\r\n    \'Who said, ah me! "A thing once done is done!"\r\n    An evil seed for all in Tuscany.\'\r\n  I added: \'Yea, and death to every one\r\n    Of thine!\' whence he, woe piled on woe, his way                110\r\n    Went like a man with grief demented grown.\r\n  But I to watch the gang made longer stay,\r\n    And something saw which I should have a fear,\r\n    Without more proof, so much as even to say,\r\n  But that my conscience bids me have good cheer--\r\n    The comrade leal whose friendship fortifies\r\n    A man beneath the mail of purpose clear.\r\n  I saw in sooth (still seems it \'fore mine eyes),\r\n    A headless trunk; with that sad company\r\n    It forward moved, and on the selfsame wise.                    120\r\n  The severed head, clutched by the hair, swung free\r\n    Down from the fist, yea, lantern-like hung down;\r\n    Staring at us it murmured: \'Wretched me!\'\r\n  A lamp he made of head-piece once his own;\r\n    And he was two in one and one in two;\r\n    But how, to Him who thus ordains is known.\r\n  Arrived beneath the bridge and full in view,\r\n    With outstretched arm his head he lifted high\r\n    To bring his words well to us. These I knew:\r\n  \'Consider well my grievous penalty,                              130\r\n    Thou who, though still alive, art visiting\r\n    The people dead; what pain with this can vie?\r\n  In order that to earth thou news mayst bring\r\n    Of me, that I\'m Bertrand de Born[732] know well,\r\n    Who gave bad counsel to the Younger King.\r\n  I son and sire made each \'gainst each rebel:\r\n    David and Absalom were fooled not more\r\n    By counsels of the false Ahithophel.\r\n  Kinsmen so close since I asunder tore,\r\n    Severed, alas!

The reference may be to the defeat of the\r\nApulians with considerable slaughter by P. Decius Mus, or to their\r\nlosses in general in the course of the Samnite war.\r\n\r\n[718] _War procrastinate_: The second Punic war lasted fully fifteen\r\nyears, and in the course of it the battle of Cann\xc3\xa6 was gained by\r\nHannibal, where so many Roman knights fell that the spoil of rings\r\namounted to a peck.\r\n\r\n[719] _Guiscard_: One of the Norman conquerors of the regions which up\r\nto our own time constituted the kingdom of Naples. In Apulia he did much\r\nfighting against Lombards, Saracens, and Greeks. He is found by Dante in\r\nParadise among those who fought for the faith (_Par._ xviii. 48). His\r\ndeath happened in Cephalonia in 1085, at the age of seventy, when he was\r\nengaged on an expedition against Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[720] _Ceperan_: In the swift and decisive campaign undertaken by\r\nCharles of Anjou against Manfred, King of Sicily and Naples, the first\r\nvictory was obtained at Ceperano; but it was won owing to the treachery\r\nof Manfred\'s lieutenant, and not by the sword. The true battle was\r\nfought at Benevento (_Purg._ iii. 128). Ceperano may be named by Dante\r\nas the field where the defeat of Manfred was virtually begun, and where\r\nthe Apulians first failed in loyalty to their gallant king. Dante was a\r\nyear old at the time of Manfred\'s overthrow (1266).\r\n\r\n[721] _Tagliacozzo_: The crown Charles had won from Manfred he had to\r\ndefend against Manfred\'s nephew Conradin (grandson and last\r\nrepresentative of Frederick II. and the legitimate heir to the kingdom\r\nof Sicily), whom, in 1268, he defeated near Tagliacozzo in the Abruzzi.\r\nHe made his victory the more complete by acting on the advice of Alardo\r\nor Erard de Valery, an old Crusader, to hold good part of his force in\r\nreserve. Charles wrote to the Pope that the slaughter was so great as\r\nfar to exceed that at Benevento. The feet of all the low-born prisoners\r\nnot slain on the field were cut off, while the gentlemen were beheaded\r\nor hanged.\r\n\r\n[722] _Mahomet_: It has been objected to Dante by M. Littr\xc3\xa9 that he\r\ntreats Mahomet, the founder of a new religion, as a mere schismatic. The\r\nwonder would have been had he dwelt on the good qualities of the Prophet\r\nat a time when Islam still threatened Europe. He goes on the fact that\r\nMahomet and his followers rent great part of the East and South from\r\nChristendom; and for this the Prophet is represented as being mutilated\r\nin a sorer degree than the other schismatics.\r\n\r\n[723] _Ali_: Son-in-law of Mahomet.\r\n\r\n[724] _Fra Dolcin_: At the close of the thirteenth century, Boniface\r\nbeing Pope, the general discontent with the corruption of the higher\r\nclergy found expression in the north of Italy in the foundation of a new\r\nsect, whose leader was Fra Dolcino. What he chiefly was--enthusiast,\r\nreformer, or impostor--it is impossible to ascertain; all we know of him\r\nbeing derived from writers in the Papal interest. Among other crimes he\r\nwas charged with that of teaching the lawfulness of telling an\r\nInquisitor a lie to save your life, and with prophesying the advent of a\r\npious Pope. A holy war on a small scale was preached against him. After\r\nsuffering the extremities of famine, snowed up as he was among the\r\nmountains, he was taken prisoner and cruelly put to death (1307). It may\r\nhave been in order to save himself from being suspected of sympathy with\r\nhim, that Dante, whose hatred of Boniface and the New Pharisees was\r\nequal to Dolcino\'s, provides for him by anticipation a place with\r\nMahomet.\r\n\r\n[725] _Pier da Medicin_: Medicina is in the territory of Bologna. Piero\r\nis said to have stirred up dissensions between the Polentas of Ravenna\r\nand the Malatestas of Rimini.\r\n\r\n[726] _From Vercelli, etc._: From the district of Vercelli to where the\r\ncastle of Marcab\xc3\xb2 once stood, at the mouth of the Po, is a distance of\r\ntwo hundred miles. The plain is Lombardy.\r\n\r\n[727] _Majolica, etc._: On all the Mediterranean, from Cyprus in the\r\neast to Majorca in the west.\r\n\r\n[728] _The traitor, etc._: The one-eyed traitor is Malatesta, lord of\r\nRimini, the Young Mastiff of the preceding Canto. He invited the two\r\nchief citizens of Fano, named in the text, to hold a conference with\r\nhim, and procured that on their way they should be pitched overboard\r\nopposite the castle of Cattolica, which stood between Fano and Rimini.\r\nThis is said to have happened in 1304.\r\n\r\n[729] _Focara_: The name of a promontory near Cattolica, subject to\r\nsqualls. The victims were never to double the headland.\r\n\r\n[730] _Curio_: The Roman Tribune who, according to Lucan--the incident\r\nis not historically correct--found C\xc3\xa6sar hesitating whether to cross the\r\nRubicon, and advised him: _Tolle moras: semper nocuit differre paratis_.\r\n\'No delay! when men are ready they always suffer by putting off.\' The\r\npassage of the Rubicon was counted as the beginning of the Civil\r\nWar.--Curio gets scant justice, seeing that in Dante\'s view C\xc3\xa6sar in all\r\nhe did was only carrying out the Divine purpose regarding the Empire.\r\n\r\n[731] _Mosca_: In 1215 one of the Florentine family of the Buondelmonti\r\njilted a daughter of the Amidei. When these with their friends met to\r\ntake counsel touching revenge for the insult, Mosca, one of the Uberti\r\nor of the Lamberti, gave his opinion in the proverb, _Cosa fatta ha\r\ncapo_: \'A thing once done is done with.\' The hint was approved of, and\r\non the following Easter morning the young Buondelmonte, as, mounted on a\r\nwhite steed and dressed in white he rode across the Ponte Vecchio, was\r\ndragged to the ground and cruelly slain. All the great Florentine\r\nfamilies took sides in the feud, and it soon widened into the civil war\r\nbetween Florentine Guelf and Ghibeline.\r\n\r\n[732] _Bertrand de Born_: Is mentioned by Dante in his Treatise _De\r\nVulgari Eloquio_, ii. 2, as specially the poet of warlike deeds. He was\r\na Gascon noble who used his poetical gift very much to stir up strife.\r\nFor patron he had the Prince Henry, son of Henry II. of England. Though\r\nHenry never came to the throne he was, during his father\'s lifetime,\r\ncrowned as his successor, and was known as the young King. After the\r\ndeath of the Prince, Bertrand was taken prisoner by the King, and,\r\naccording to the legend, was loaded with favours because he had been so\r\ntrue a friend to his young master. That he had a turn for fomenting\r\ndiscord is shown by his having also led a revolt in Aquitaine against\r\nRichard I.--All the old MSS. and all the earlier commentators read _Re\r\nGiovanni_, King John; _Re Giovane_, the young King, being a\r\ncomparatively modern emendation. In favour of adopting this it may be\r\nmentioned that in his poems Bertrand calls Prince Henry _lo Reys joves_,\r\nthe young King; that it was Henry and not John that was his friend and\r\npatron; and that in the old _Cento Novelle_ Henry is described as the\r\nyoung King: in favour of the older reading, that John as well as his\r\nbrother was a rebel to Henry; and that the line is hurt by the change\r\nfrom _Giovanni_ to _Giovane_. Considering that Dante almost certainly\r\nwrote _Giovanni_ it seems most reasonable to suppose that he may have\r\nconfounded the _Re Giovane_ with King John.\r\n\r\n[733] _From what, etc._: The spinal cord, as we should now say, though\r\nDante may have meant the heart.\r\n\r\n[734] _Pain for pain_: In the City of Dis we found the heresiarchs,\r\nthose who lead others to think falsely. The lower depth of the Malebolge\r\nis reserved for such as needlessly rend any Divinely-constituted order\r\nof society, civil or religious. Conduct counts more with Dante than\r\nopinion--in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The many folk and wounds of divers kind\r\n    Had flushed mine eyes and set them on the flow,\r\n    Till I to weep and linger had a mind;\r\n  But Virgil said to me: \'Why gazing so?\r\n    Why still thy vision fastening on the crew\r\n    Of dismal shades dismembered there below?\r\n  Thou didst not[735] thus the other Bolgias view:\r\n    Think, if to count them be thine enterprise,\r\n    The valley circles twenty miles and two.[736]\r\n  Beneath our feet the moon[737] already lies;                      10\r\n    The time[738] wears fast away to us decreed;\r\n    And greater things than these await thine eyes.\'\r\n  I answered swift: \'Hadst thou but given heed\r\n    To why it was my looks were downward bent,\r\n    To yet more stay thou mightest have agreed.\'\r\n  My Guide meanwhile was moving, and I went\r\n    Behind him and continued to reply,\r\n    Adding: \'Within the moat on which intent\r\n  I now was gazing with such eager eye\r\n    I trow a spirit weeps, one of my kin,                           20\r\n    The crime whose guilt is rated there so high.\'\r\n  Then said the Master: \'Henceforth hold thou in\r\n    Thy thoughts from wandering to him: new things claim\r\n    Attention now, so leave him with his sin.\r\n  Him saw I at thee from the bridge-foot aim\r\n    A threatening finger, while he made thee known;\r\n    Geri del Bello[739] heard I named his name.\r\n  But, at the time, thou wast with him alone\r\n    Engrossed who once held Hautefort,[740] nor the place\r\n    Didst look at where he was; so passed he on.\'                   30\r\n  \'O Leader mine! death violent and base,\r\n    And not avenged as yet,\' I made reply,\r\n    \'By any of his partners in disgrace,\r\n  Made him disdainful; therefore went he by\r\n    And spake not with me, if I judge aright;\r\n    Which does the more my ruth[741] intensify.\'\r\n  So we conversed till from the cliff we might\r\n    Of the next valley have had prospect good\r\n    Down to the bottom, with but clearer light.[742]\r\n  When we above the inmost Cloister stood                           40\r\n    Of Malebolge, and discerned the crew\r\n    Of such as there compose the Brotherhood,[743]\r\n  So many lamentations pierced me through--\r\n    And barbed with pity all the shafts were sped--\r\n    My open palms across my ears I drew.\r\n  From Valdichiana\'s[744] every spital bed\r\n    All ailments to September from July,\r\n    With all in Maremma and Sardinia[745] bred,\r\n  Heaped in one pit a sickness might supply\r\n    Like what was here; and from it rose a stink                    50\r\n    Like that which comes from limbs that putrefy.\r\n  Then we descended by the utmost brink\r\n    Of the long ridge[746]--leftward once more we fell--\r\n    Until my vision, quickened now, could sink\r\n  Deeper to where Justice infallible,\r\n    The minister of the Almighty Lord,\r\n    Chastises forgers doomed on earth[747] to Hell.\r\n  \xc3\x86gina[748] could no sadder sight afford,\r\n    As I believe (when all the people ailed\r\n    And all the air was so with sickness stored,                    60\r\n  Down to the very worms creation failed\r\n    And died, whereon the pristine folk once more,\r\n    As by the poets is for certain held,\r\n  From seed of ants their family did restore),\r\n    Than what was offered by that valley black\r\n    With plague-struck spirits heaped upon the floor.\r\n  Supine some lay, each on the other\'s back\r\n    Or stomach; and some crawled with crouching gait\r\n    For change of place along the doleful track.\r\n  Speechless we moved with step deliberate,                         70\r\n    With eyes and ears on those disease crushed down\r\n    Nor left them power to lift their bodies straight.\r\n  I saw two sit, shoulder to shoulder thrown\r\n    As plate holds plate up to be warmed, from head\r\n    Down to the feet with scurf and scab o\'ergrown.\r\n  Nor ever saw I curry-comb so plied\r\n    By varlet with his master standing by,\r\n    Or by one kept unwillingly from bed,\r\n  As I saw each of these his scratchers ply\r\n    Upon himself; for nought else now avails                        80\r\n    Against the itch which plagues them furiously.\r\n  The scab[749] they tore and loosened with their nails,\r\n    As with a knife men use the bream to strip,\r\n    Or any other fish with larger scales.\r\n  \'Thou, that thy mail dost with thy fingers rip,\'\r\n    My Guide to one of them began to say,\r\n    \'And sometimes dost with them as pincers nip,\r\n  Tell, is there any here from Italy\r\n    Among you all, so may thy nails suffice\r\n    For this their work to all eternity.\'[750]                      90\r\n  \'Latians are both of us in this disguise\r\n    Of wretchedness,\' weeping said one of those;\r\n    \'But who art thou, demanding on this wise?\'\r\n  My Guide made answer: \'I am one who goes\r\n    Down with this living man from steep to steep\r\n    That I to him Inferno may disclose.\'\r\n  Then broke their mutual prop; trembling with deep\r\n    Amazement each turned to me, with the rest\r\n    To whom his words had echoed in the heap.\r\n  Me the good Master cordially addressed:                          100\r\n    \'Whate\'er thou hast a mind to ask them, say.\'\r\n    And since he wished it, thus I made request:\r\n  \'So may remembrance of you not decay\r\n    Within the upper world out of the mind\r\n    Of men, but flourish still for many a day,\r\n  As ye shall tell your names and what your kind:\r\n    Let not your vile, disgusting punishment\r\n    To full confession make you disinclined.\'\r\n  \'An Aretine,[751] I to the stake was sent\r\n    By Albert of Siena,\' one confessed,                            110\r\n    \'But came not here through that for which I went\r\n  To death. \'Tis true I told him all in jest,\r\n    I through the air could float in upward gyre;\r\n    And he, inquisitive and dull at best,\r\n  Did full instruction in the art require:\r\n    I could not make him D\xc3\xa6dalus,[752] so then\r\n    His second father sent me to the fire.\r\n  But to the deepest Bolgia of the ten,\r\n    For alchemy which in the world I wrought,\r\n    The unerring Minos doomed me.\' \'Now were men\r\n  E\'er found,\' I of the Poet asked, \'so fraught                    121\r\n    With vanity as are the Sienese?[753]\r\n    French vanity to theirs is surely nought.\'\r\n  The other leper hearing me, to these\r\n    My words: \'Omit the Stricca,\'[754] swift did shout,\r\n    \'Who knew his tastes with temperance to please;\r\n  And Nicholas,[755] who earliest found out\r\n    The lavish custom of the clove-stuffed roast\r\n    Within the garden where such seed doth sprout.\r\n  Nor count the club[756] where Caccia d\' Ascian lost              130\r\n    Vineyards and woods; \'mid whom away did throw\r\n    His wit the Abbagliato.[757] But whose ghost\r\n  It is, that thou mayst weet, that backs thee so\r\n    Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eyes\r\n    That thou my countenance mayst surely know.\r\n  In me Capocchio\'s[758] shade thou\'lt recognise,\r\n    Who forged false coin by means of alchemy:\r\n    Thou must remember, if I well surmise,\r\n  How I of nature very ape could be.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[735] _Thou didst not, etc._: It is a noteworthy feature in the conduct\r\nof the Poem that when Dante has once gained sufficient knowledge of any\r\ngroup in the Inferno he at once detaches his mind from it, and, carrying\r\non as little arrear of pity as he can, gives his thoughts to further\r\nprogress on the journey. The departure here made from his usual\r\nbehaviour is presently accounted for. Virgil knows why he lingers, but\r\nwill not seem to approve of the cause.\r\n\r\n[736] _Twenty miles and two_: The Ninth Bolgia has a circumference of\r\ntwenty-two miles, and as the procession of the shades is slow it would\r\nindeed involve a protracted halt to wait till all had passed beneath the\r\nbridge. Virgil asks ironically if he wishes to count them all. This\r\nprecise detail, taken along with one of the same kind in the following\r\nCanto (line 86), has suggested the attempt to construct the Inferno to a\r\nscale. Dante wisely suffers us to forget, if we will, that--taking the\r\ndiameter of the earth at 6500 miles, as given by him in the\r\n_Convito_--he travels from the surface of the globe to the centre at the\r\nrate of more than two miles a minute, counting downward motion alone. It\r\nis only when he has come to the lowest rings that he allows himself to\r\ngive details of size; and probably the mention of the extent of the\r\nNinth Bolgia, which comes on the reader as a surprise, is thrown out in\r\norder to impress on the imagination some sense of the enormous extent of\r\nthe regions through which the pilgrim has already passed. Henceforth he\r\ndeals in exact measurement.\r\n\r\n[737] _The moon_: It is now some time after noon on the Saturday. The\r\nlast indication of time was at Canto xxi. 112.\r\n\r\n[738] _The time, etc._: Before nightfall they are to complete their\r\nexploration of the Inferno, and they will have spent twenty-four hours\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n[739] _Geri del Bello_: One of the Alighieri, a full cousin of Dante\'s\r\nfather. He was guilty of encouraging dissension, say the commentators;\r\nwhich is to be clearly inferred from the place assigned him in Inferno:\r\nbut they do not agree as to how he met his death, nor do they mention\r\nthe date of it. \'Not avenged till thirty years after,\' says Landino; but\r\ndoes not say if this was after his death or the time at which Dante\r\nwrites.\r\n\r\n[740] _Hautefort_: Bertrand de Born\'s castle in Gascony.\r\n\r\n[741] _My ruth_: Enlightened moralist though Dante is, he yet shows\r\nhimself man of his age enough to be keenly alive to the extremest claims\r\nof kindred; and while he condemns the _vendetta_ by the words put into\r\nVirgil\'s mouth, he confesses to a feeling of meanness not to have\r\npractised it on behoof of a distant relative. There is a high art in\r\nthis introduction of Geri del Bello. Had they conferred together Dante\r\nmust have seemed either cruel or pusillanimous, reproaching or being\r\nreproached. As it is, all the poetry of the situation comes out the\r\nstronger that they do not meet face to face: the threatening finger, the\r\nquestions hastily put to Geri by the astonished shades, and his\r\ndisappearance under the dark vault when by the law of his punishment the\r\nsinner can no longer tarry.\r\n\r\n[742] _With but clearer light_: They have crossed the rampart dividing\r\nthe Ninth Bolgia from the Tenth, of which they would now command a view,\r\nwere it not so dark.\r\n\r\n[743] _The Brotherhood_: The word used properly describes the Lay\r\nBrothers of a monastery. Philalethes suggests that Dante may regard the\r\ndevils as the true monks of the monastery of Malebolge. The simile\r\ninvolves no contempt for the monastic life, but is naturally used with\r\nreference to those who live secluded and under a fixed rule. He\r\nelsewhere speaks of the College of the Hypocrites (_Inf._ xxiii. 91) and\r\nof Paradise as the Cloister where Christ is Abbot (_Purg._ xxvi.129).\r\n\r\n[744] _Valdichiana_: The district lying between Arezzo and Chiusi; in\r\nDante\'s time a hotbed of malaria, but now, owing to drainage works\r\npromoted by the enlightened Tuscan minister Fossombroni (1823), one of\r\nthe most fertile and healthy regions of Italy.\r\n\r\n[745] _Sardinia_: Had in the middle ages an evil reputation for its\r\nfever-stricken air. The Maremma has been already mentioned (_Inf._\r\nxxv.19). In Dante\'s time it was almost unpeopled.\r\n\r\n[746] _The long ridge_: One of the ribs of rock which, like the spokes\r\nof a wheel, ran from the periphery to the centre of Malebolge, rising\r\ninto arches as they crossed each successive Bolgia. The utmost brink is\r\nthe inner bank of the Tenth and last Bolgia. To the edge of this moat\r\nthey descend, bearing as usual to the left hand.\r\n\r\n[747] _Doomed on earth, etc._: \'Whom she here registers.\' While they are\r\nstill on earth their doom is fixed by Divine justice.\r\n\r\n[748] _\xc3\x86gina_: The description is taken from Ovid (_Metam._ vii.).\r\n\r\n[749] _The scab, etc._: As if by an infernal alchemy the matter of the\r\nshadowy bodies of these sinners is changed into one loathsome form or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[750] _To all eternity_: This may seem a stroke of sarcasm, but is not.\r\nHimself a shade, Virgil cannot, like Dante, promise to refresh the\r\nmemory of the shades on earth, and can only wish for them some slight\r\nalleviation of their suffering.\r\n\r\n[751] _An Aretine_: Called Griffolino, and burned at Florence or Siena\r\non a charge of heresy. Albert of Siena is said to have been a relative,\r\nsome say the natural son, of the Bishop of Siena. A man of the name\r\nfigures as hero in some of Sacchetti\'s novels, always in a ridiculous\r\nlight. There seems to be no authentic testimony regarding the incident\r\nin the text.\r\n\r\n[752] _D\xc3\xa6dalus_: Who escaped on wings of his invention from the Cretan\r\nLabyrinth he had made and lost himself in.\r\n\r\n[753] _The Sienese_: The comparison of these to the French would have\r\nthe more cogency as Siena boasted of having been founded by the Gauls.\r\n\'That vain people,\' says Dante of the Sienese in the _Purgatory_ (xiii.\r\n151). Among their neighbours they still bear the reputation of\r\nlight-headedness; also, it ought to be added, of great urbanity.\r\n\r\n[754] _The Stricca_: The exception in his favour is ironical, as is that\r\nof all the others mentioned.\r\n\r\n[755] _Nicholas_: \'The lavish custom of the clove\' which he invented is\r\nvariously described. I have chosen the version which makes it consist of\r\nstuffing pheasants with cloves, then very costly.\r\n\r\n[756] _The club_: The commentators tell that the two young Sienese\r\nnobles above mentioned were members of a society formed for the purpose\r\nof living luxuriously together. Twelve of them contributed a fund of\r\nabove two hundred thousand gold florins; they built a great palace and\r\nfurnished it magnificently, and launched out into every other sort of\r\nextravagance with such assiduity that in a few months their capital was\r\ngone. As that amounted to more than a hundred thousand pounds of our\r\nmoney, equal in those days to a million or two, the story must be held\r\nto savour of romance. That Dante refers to a prodigal\'s club that\r\nactually existed some time before he wrote we cannot doubt. But it seems\r\nuncertain, to say the least, whether the sonnets addressed by the Tuscan\r\npoet Folgore da Gemignano to a jovial crew in Siena can be taken as\r\nhaving been inspired by the club Dante speaks of. A translation of them\r\nis given by Mr. Rossetti in his _Circle of Dante_. (See Mr. Symonds\'s\r\n_Renaissance_, vol. iv. page 54, _note_, for doubts as to the date of\r\nFolgore.)--_Caccia d\' Ascian_: Whose short and merry club life cost him\r\nhis estates near Siena.\r\n\r\n[757] _The Abbagliato_: Nothing is known, though a great deal is\r\nguessed, about this member of the club. It is enough to know that,\r\nhaving a scant supply of wit, he spent it freely.\r\n\r\n[758] _Capocchio_: Some one whom Dante knew. Whether he was a Florentine\r\nor a Sienese is not ascertained, but from the strain of his mention of\r\nthe Sienese we may guess Florentine. He was burned in Siena in\r\n1293.--(Scartazzini.) They had studied together, says the _Anonimo_.\r\nBenvenuto tells of him that one Good Friday, while in a cloister, he\r\npainted on his nail with marvellous completeness a picture of the\r\ncrucifixion. Dante came up, and was lost in wonder, when Capocchio\r\nsuddenly licked his nail clean--which may be taken for what it is worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Because of Semele[759] when Juno\'s ire\r\n    Was fierce \'gainst all that were to Thebes allied,\r\n    As had been proved by many an instance dire;\r\n  So mad grew Athamas[760] that when he spied\r\n    His wife as she with children twain drew near,\r\n    Each hand by one encumbered, loud he cried:\r\n  \'Be now the nets outspread, that I may snare\r\n    Cubs with the lioness at yon strait ground!\'\r\n    And stretching claws of all compassion bare\r\n  He on Learchus seized and swung him round,                        10\r\n    And shattered him upon a flinty stone;\r\n    Then she herself and the other burden drowned.\r\n  And when by fortune was all overthrown\r\n    The Trojans\' pride, inordinate before--\r\n    Monarch and kingdom equally undone--\r\n  Hecuba,[761] sad and captive, mourning o\'er\r\n    Polyxena, when dolorous she beheld\r\n    The body of her darling Polydore\r\n  Upon the coast, out of her wits she yelled,\r\n    And spent herself in barking like a hound;                      20\r\n    So by her sorrow was her reason quelled.\r\n  But never yet was Trojan fury[762] found,\r\n    Nor that of Thebes, to sting so cruelly\r\n    Brute beasts, far less the human form to wound,\r\n  As two pale naked shades were stung, whom I\r\n    Saw biting run, like swine when they escape\r\n    Famished and eager from the empty sty.\r\n  Capocchio[763] coming up to, in his nape\r\n    One fixed his fangs, and hauling at him made\r\n    His belly on the stony pavement scrape.                         30\r\n  The Aretine[764] who stood, still trembling, said:\r\n    \'That imp is Gianni Schicchi,[765] and he goes\r\n    Rabid, thus trimming others.\' \'O!\' I prayed,\r\n  \'So may the teeth of the other one of those\r\n    Not meet in thee, as, ere she pass from sight,\r\n    Thou freely shalt the name of her disclose.\'\r\n  And he to me: \'That is the ancient sprite\r\n    Of shameless Myrrha,[766] who let liking rise\r\n    For him who got her, past all bounds of right.\r\n  As, to transgress with him, she in disguise                       40\r\n    Came near to him deception to maintain;\r\n    So he, departing yonder from our eyes,\r\n  That he the Lady of the herd might gain,\r\n    Bequeathed his goods by formal testament\r\n    While he Buoso Donate\'s[767] form did feign.\'\r\n  And when the rabid couple from us went,\r\n    Who all this time by me were being eyed,\r\n    Upon the rest ill-starred I grew intent;\r\n  And, fashioned like a lute, I one espied,\r\n    Had he been only severed at the place                           50\r\n    Where at the groin men\'s lower limbs divide.\r\n  The grievous dropsy, swol\'n with humours base,\r\n    Which every part of true proportion strips\r\n    Till paunch grows out of keeping with the face,\r\n  Compelled him widely ope to hold his lips\r\n    Like one in fever who, by thirst possessed,\r\n    Has one drawn up while the other chinward slips.\r\n  \'O ye![768] who by no punishment distressed,\r\n    Nor know I why, are in this world of dool,\'\r\n    He said; \'a while let your attention rest                       60\r\n  On Master Adam[769] here of misery full.\r\n    Living, I all I wished enjoyed at will;\r\n    Now lust I for a drop of water cool.\r\n  The water-brooks that down each grassy hill\r\n    Of Casentino to the Arno fall\r\n    And with cool moisture all their courses fill--\r\n  Always, and not in vain, I see them all;\r\n    Because the vision of them dries me more\r\n    Than the disease \'neath which my face grows small.\r\n  For rigid justice, me chastising sore,                            70\r\n    Can in the place I sinned at motive find\r\n    To swell the sighs in which I now deplore.\r\n  There lies Romena, where of the money coined[770]\r\n    With the Baptist\'s image I made counterfeit,\r\n    And therefore left my body burnt behind.\r\n  But could I see here Guido\'s[771] wretched sprite,\r\n    Or Alexander\'s, or their brother\'s, I\r\n    For Fonte Branda[772] would not give the sight.\r\n  One is already here, unless they lie--\r\n    Mad souls with power to wander through the crowd--\r\n    What boots it me, whose limbs diseases tie?                     81\r\n  But were I yet so nimble that I could\r\n    Creep one poor inch a century, some while\r\n    Ago had I begun to take the road\r\n  Searching for him among this people vile;\r\n    And that although eleven miles[773] \'tis long,\r\n    And has a width of more than half a mile.\r\n  Because of them am I in such a throng;\r\n    For to forge florins I by them was led,\r\n    Which by three carats[774] of alloy were wrong,\'                90\r\n  \'Who are the wretches twain,\' I to him said,\r\n    \'Who smoke[775] like hand in winter-time fresh brought\r\n    From water, on thy right together spread?\'\r\n  \'Here found I them, nor have they budged a jot,\'\r\n    He said, \'since I was hurled into this vale;\r\n    And, as I deem, eternally they\'ll not.\r\n  One[776] with false charges Joseph did assail;\r\n    False Sinon,[777] Greek from Troy, is the other wight.\r\n    Burning with fever they this stink exhale.\'\r\n  Then one of them, perchance o\'ercome with spite                  100\r\n    Because he thus contemptuously was named,\r\n    Smote with his fist upon the belly tight.\r\n  It sounded like a drum; and then was aimed\r\n    A blow by Master Adam at his face\r\n    With arm no whit less hard, while he exclaimed:\r\n  \'What though I can no longer shift my place\r\n    Because my members by disease are weighed!\r\n    I have an arm still free for such a case.\'\r\n  To which was answered: \'When thou wast conveyed\r\n    Unto the fire \'twas not thus good at need,                     110\r\n    But even more so when the coiner\'s trade\r\n  Was plied by thee.\' The swol\'n one: \'True indeed!\r\n    But thou didst not bear witness half so true\r\n    When Trojans[778] at thee for the truth did plead.\'\r\n  \'If I spake falsely, thou didst oft renew\r\n    False coin,\' said Sinon; \'one fault brought me here;\r\n    Thee more than any devil of the crew.\'\r\n  \'Bethink thee of the horse, thou perjurer,\'\r\n    He of the swol\'n paunch answered; \'and that by\r\n    All men \'tis known should anguish in thee stir.\'               120\r\n  \'Be thirst that cracks thy tongue thy penalty,\r\n    And putrid water,\' so the Greek replied,\r\n    \'Which \'fore thine eyes thy stomach moundeth high.\'\r\n  The coiner then: \'Thy mouth thou openest wide,\r\n    As thou art used, thy slanderous words to vent;\r\n    But if I thirst and humours plump my hide\r\n  Thy head throbs with the fire within thee pent.\r\n    To lap Narcissus\' mirror,[779] to implore\r\n    And urge thee on would need no argument.\'\r\n  While I to hear them did attentive pore                          130\r\n    My Master said: \'Thy fill of staring take!\r\n    To rouse my anger needs but little more.\'\r\n  And when I heard that he in anger spake\r\n    Toward him I turned with such a shame inspired,\r\n    Recalled, it seems afresh on me to break.\r\n  And, as the man who dreams of hurt is fired\r\n    With wish that he might know his dream a dream,\r\n    And so what is, as \'twere not, is desired;\r\n  So I, struck dumb and filled with an extreme\r\n    Craving to find excuse, unwittingly                            140\r\n    The meanwhile made the apology supreme.\r\n  \'Less shame,\' my Master said, \'would nullify\r\n    A greater fault, for greater guilt atone;\r\n    All sadness for it, therefore, lay thou by.\r\n  But bear in mind that thou art not alone,\r\n    If fortune hap again to bring thee near\r\n    Where people such debate are carrying on.\r\n  To things like these \'tis shame[780] to lend an ear.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[759] _Semele_: The daughter of Cadmus, founder and king of Thebes, was\r\nbeloved by Jupiter and therefore hated by Juno, who induced her to court\r\ndestruction by urging the god to visit her, as he was used to come to\r\nJuno, in all his glory. And in other instances the goddess took revenge\r\n(Ovid, _Metam._ iv.).\r\n\r\n[760] _Athamas_: Married to a sister of Semele, was made insane by the\r\nangry Juno, with the result described in the text.\r\n\r\n[761] _Hecuba_: Wife of Priam, king of Troy, and mother of Polyxena and\r\nPolydorus. While she was lamenting the death of her daughter, slain as\r\nan offering on the tomb of Achilles, she found the corpse of her son,\r\nslain by the king of Thrace, to whose keeping she had committed him\r\n(Ovid, _Metam._ xiii.).\r\n\r\n[762] _Trojan fury, etc._: It was by the agency of a Fury that Athamas\r\nwas put out of his mind; but the Trojan and Theban furies here meant are\r\nthe frenzies of Athamas and Hecuba, wild with which one of them slew his\r\nson, and the other scratched out the eyes of the Thracian king.\r\n\r\n[763] _Capocchio_: See close of the preceding Canto. Here as elsewhere\r\nsinners are made ministers of vengeance on one another.\r\n\r\n[764] _The Aretine_: Griffolino, who boasted he could fly; already\r\nrepresented as trembling (_Inf._ xxix. 97).\r\n\r\n[765] _Gianni Schicchi_: Giovanni Schicchi, one of the Cavalcanti of\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\n[766] _Myrrha_: This is a striking example of Dante\'s detestation of\r\nwhat may be called heartless sins. It is covered by the classification\r\nof Canto xi. Yet it is almost with a shock that we find Myrrha here for\r\npersonation, and not rather condemned to some other circle for another\r\nsin.\r\n\r\n[767] _Buoso Donati_: Introduced as a thief in the Seventh Bolgia\r\n(_Inf._ xxv. 140). Buoso was possessed of a peerless mare, known as the\r\nLady of the herd. To make some amends for his unscrupulous acquisition\r\nof wealth, he made a will bequeathing legacies to various religious\r\ncommunities. When he died his nephew Simon kept the fact concealed long\r\nenough to procure a personation of him as if on his death-bed by Gianni\r\nSchicchi, who had great powers of mimicry. Acting in the character of\r\nBuoso, the rogue professed his wish to make a new disposition of his\r\nmeans, and after specifying some trifling charitable bequests the better\r\nto maintain his assumed character, named Simon as general legatee, and\r\nbequeathed Buoso\'s mare to himself.\r\n\r\n[768] _O ye, etc._: The speaker has heard and noted Virgil\'s words of\r\nexplanation given in the previous Canto, line 94.\r\n\r\n[769] _Master Adam_: Adam of Brescia, an accomplished worker in metals,\r\nwas induced by the Counts Guidi of Romena in the Casentino, the upland\r\ndistrict of the upper Arno, to counterfeit the gold coin of Florence.\r\nThis false coin is mentioned in a Chronicle as having been in\r\ncirculation in 1281. It must therefore have been somewhat later that\r\nMaster Adam was burned, as he was by sentence of the Republic, upon the\r\nroad which led from Romena to Florence. A cairn still existing near the\r\nruined castle bears the name of the \'dead man\'s cairn.\'\r\n\r\n[770] _The money coined, etc._: The gold florin, afterwards adopted in\r\nso many countries, was first struck in 1252; \'which florins weighed\r\neight to the ounce, and bore the lily on the one side, and on the other\r\nSaint John.\'--(Villani, vi. 54.) The piece was thus of about the weight\r\nof our half-sovereign. The gold was of twenty-four carats; that is, it\r\nhad no alloy. The coin soon passed into wide circulation, and to\r\nmaintain its purity became for the Florentines a matter of the first\r\nimportance. Villani, in the chapter above cited, tells how the King of\r\nTunis finding the florin to be of pure gold sent for some of the Pisans,\r\nthen the chief traders in his ports, and asked who were the Florentines\r\nthat they coined such money. \'Only our Arabs,\' was the answer; meaning\r\nthat they were rough country folk, dependent on Pisa. \'Then what is your\r\ncoin like?\' he asked. A Florentine of Oltrarno named Pera Balducci, who\r\nwas present, took the opportunity of informing him how great Florence\r\nwas compared with Pisa, as was shown by that city having no gold coinage\r\nof its own; whereupon the King made the Florentines free of Tunis, and\r\nallowed them to have a factory there. \'And this,\' adds Villani, who had\r\nhimself been agent abroad for a great Florentine house of business, \'we\r\nhad at first hand from the aforesaid Pera, a man worthy of credit, and\r\nwith whom we were associated in the Priorate.\'\r\n\r\n[771] _Guido, etc._: The Guidi of Romena were a branch of the great\r\nfamily of the Counts Guidi. The father of the three brothers in the text\r\nwas grandson of the old Guido that married the Good Gualdrada, and\r\ncousin of the Guidoguerra met by Dante in the Seventh Circle (_Inf._\r\nxvi. 38). How the third brother was called is not settled, nor which of\r\nthe three was already dead in the beginning of 1300. The Alexander of\r\nRomena, who for some time was captain of the banished Florentine Whites,\r\nwas, most probably, he of the text. A letter is extant professing to be\r\nwritten by Dante to two of Alexander\'s nephews on the occasion of his\r\ndeath, in which the poet excuses himself for absence from the funeral on\r\nthe plea of poverty. By the time he wrote the _Inferno_ he may, owing to\r\ntheir shifty politics, have lost all liking for the family, yet it seems\r\nharsh measure that is here dealt to former friends and patrons.\r\n\r\n[772] _Fonte Branda_: A celebrated fountain in the city of Siena. Near\r\nRomena is a spring which is also named Fonte Branda; and this, according\r\nto the view now most in favour, was meant by Master Adam. But was it so\r\nnamed in Dante\'s time? Or was it not so called only when the _Comedy_\r\nhad begun to awaken a natural interest in the old coiner, which local\r\ningenuity did its best to meet? The early commentators know nothing of\r\nthe Casentino Fonte Branda, and, though it is found mentioned under the\r\ndate of 1539, that does not take us far enough back. In favour of the\r\nSienese fountain is the consideration that it was the richest of any in\r\nthe Tuscan cities; that it was a great architectural as well as\r\nengineering work; and that, although now more than half a century old,\r\nit was still the subject of curiosity with people far and near. Besides,\r\nAdam has already recalled the brooks of Casentino, and so the mention of\r\nthe paltry spring at Romena would introduce no fresh idea like that of\r\nthe abundant waters of the great fountain which daily quenched the\r\nthirst of thousands.\r\n\r\n[773] _Eleven miles_: It will be remembered that the previous Bolgia was\r\ntwenty-two miles in circumference.\r\n\r\n[774] _Three carats_: Three carats in twenty-four being of some foreign\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n[775] _Who smoke, etc._: This description of sufferers from high fever,\r\nlike that of Master Adam with his tympanitis, has the merit, such as it\r\nis, of being true to the life.\r\n\r\n[776] _One, etc._: Potiphar\'s wife.\r\n\r\n[777] _Sinon_: Called of Troy, as being known through his conduct at the\r\nsiege. He pretended to have deserted from the Greeks, and by a false\r\nstory persuaded the Trojans to admit the fatal wooden horse.\r\n\r\n[778] _When Trojans, etc._: When King Priam sought to know for what\r\npurpose the wooden horse was really constructed.\r\n\r\n[779] _Narcissus\' mirror_: The pool in which Narcissus saw his form\r\nreflected.\r\n\r\n[780] _\'Tis shame_: Dante knows that Virgil would have scorned to\r\nportray such a scene of low life as this, but he must allow himself a\r\nwider licence and here as elsewhere refuses nothing, even in the way of\r\nmean detail, calculated to convey to his readers \'a full experience of\r\nthe Inferno\' as he conceived of it--the place \'where all the vileness of\r\nthe world is cast.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The very tongue that first had caused me pain,\r\n    Biting till both my cheeks were crimsoned o\'er,\r\n    With healing medicine me restored again.\r\n  So have I heard, the lance Achilles[781] bore,\r\n    Which earlier was his father\'s, first would wound\r\n    And then to health the wounded part restore.\r\n  From that sad valley[782] we our backs turned round,\r\n    Up the encircling rampart making way\r\n    Nor uttering, as we crossed it, any sound.\r\n  Here was it less than night and less than day,                    10\r\n    And scarce I saw at all what lay ahead;\r\n    But of a trumpet the sonorous bray--\r\n  No thunder-peal were heard beside it--led\r\n    Mine eyes along the line by which it passed,\r\n    Till on one spot their gaze concentrated.\r\n  When by the dolorous rout was overcast\r\n    The sacred enterprise of Charlemagne\r\n    Roland[783] blew not so terrible a blast.\r\n  Short time my head was that way turned, when plain\r\n    I many lofty towers appeared to see.                            20\r\n    \'Master, what town is this?\' I asked. \'Since fain\r\n  Thou art,\' he said, \'to pierce the obscurity\r\n    While yet through distance \'tis inscrutable,\r\n    Thou must of error needs the victim be.\r\n  Arriving there thou shalt distinguish well\r\n    How much by distance was thy sense betrayed;\r\n    Therefore to swifter course thyself compel.\'\r\n  Then tenderly[784] he took my hand, and said:\r\n    \'Ere we pass further I would have thee know,\r\n    That at the fact thou mayst be less dismayed,                   30\r\n  These are not towers but giants; in a row\r\n    Set round the brink each in the pit abides,\r\n    His navel hidden and the parts below.\'\r\n  And even as when the veil of mist divides\r\n    Little by little dawns upon the sight\r\n    What the obscuring vapour earlier hides;\r\n  So, piercing the gross air uncheered by light,\r\n    As I step after step drew near the bound\r\n    My error fled, but I was filled with fright.\r\n  As Montereggion[785] with towers is crowned                       40\r\n    Which from the walls encircling it arise;\r\n    So, rising from the pit\'s encircling mound,\r\n  Half of their bodies towered before mine eyes--\r\n    Dread giants, still by Jupiter defied\r\n    From Heaven whene\'er it thunders in the skies.\r\n  The face of one already I descried,\r\n    His shoulders, breast, and down his belly far,\r\n    And both his arms dependent by his side.\r\n  When Nature ceased such creatures as these are\r\n    To form, she of a surety wisely wrought                         50\r\n    Wresting from Mars such ministers of war.\r\n  And though she rue not that to life she brought\r\n    The whale and elephant, who deep shall read\r\n    Will justify her wisdom in his thought;\r\n  For when the powers of intellect are wed\r\n    To strength and evil will, with them made one,\r\n    The race of man is helpless left indeed.\r\n  As large and long as is St. Peter\'s cone[786]\r\n    At Rome, the face appeared; of every limb\r\n    On scale like this was fashioned every bone.                    60\r\n  So that the bank, which covered half of him\r\n    As might a tunic, left uncovered yet\r\n    So much that if to his hair they sought to climb\r\n  Three Frisians[787] end on end their match had met;\r\n    For thirty great palms I of him could see,\r\n    Counting from where a man\'s cloak-clasp is set.\r\n  _Rafel[788] mai amech zabi almi!_\r\n    Out of the bestial mouth began to roll,\r\n    Which scarce would suit more dulcet psalmody.\r\n  And then my Leader charged him: \'Stupid soul,                     70\r\n    Stick to thy horn. With it relieve thy mind\r\n    When rage or other passions pass control.\r\n  Feel at thy neck, round which the thong is twined\r\n    O puzzle-headed wretch! from which \'tis slung;\r\n    Clipping thy monstrous breast thou shalt it find.\'\r\n  And then to me: \'From his own mouth is wrung\r\n    Proof of his guilt. \'Tis Nimrod, whose insane\r\n    Whim hindered men from speaking in one tongue.\r\n  Leave we him here nor spend our speech in vain;\r\n    For words to him in any language said,                          80\r\n    As unto others his, no sense contain.\'\r\n  Turned to the left, we on our journey sped,\r\n    And at the distance of an arrow\'s flight\r\n    We found another huger and more dread.\r\n  By what artificer thus pinioned tight\r\n    I cannot tell, but his left arm was bound\r\n    In front, as at his back was bound the right,\r\n  By a chain which girt him firmly round and round;\r\n    About what of his frame there was displayed\r\n    Below the neck, in fivefold gyre \'twas wound.                   90\r\n  \'Incited by ambition this one made\r\n    Trial of prowess \'gainst Almighty Jove,\'\r\n    My Leader told, \'and he is thus repaid.\r\n  \'Tis Ephialtes,[789] mightily who strove\r\n    What time the giants to the gods caused fright:\r\n    The arms he wielded then no more will move.\'\r\n  And I to him: \'Fain would I, if I might,\r\n    On the enormous Briareus set eye,\r\n    And know the truth by holding him in sight.\'\r\n  \'Ant\xc3\xa6us[790] thou shalt see,\' he made reply,                     100\r\n    \'Ere long, and he can speak, nor is in chains.\r\n    Us to the depth of all iniquity\r\n  He shall let down. The one thou\'dst see[791] remains\r\n    Far off, like this one bound and like in make,\r\n    But in his face far more of fierceness reigns.\'\r\n  Never when earth most terribly did quake\r\n    Shook any tower so much as what all o\'er\r\n    And suddenly did Ephialtes shake.\r\n  Terror of death possessed me more and more;\r\n    The fear alone had served my turn indeed,                      110\r\n    But that I marked the ligatures he wore.\r\n  Then did we somewhat further on proceed,\r\n    Reaching Ant\xc3\xa6us who for good five ell,[792]\r\n    His head not counted, from the pit was freed.\r\n  \'O thou who from the fortune-haunted dell[793]--\r\n    Where Scipio of glory was made heir\r\n    When with his host to flight turned Hannibal--\r\n  A thousand lions didst for booty bear\r\n    Away, and who, hadst thou but joined the host\r\n    And like thy brethren fought, some even aver                   120\r\n  The victory to earth\'s sons had not been lost,\r\n    Lower us now, nor disobliging show,\r\n    To where Cocytus[794] fettered is by frost.\r\n  To Tityus[795] nor to Typhon make us go.\r\n    To grant what here is longed for he hath power,\r\n    Cease them to curl thy snout, but bend thee low.\r\n  He can for wage thy name on earth restore;\r\n    He lives, and still expecteth to live long,\r\n    If Grace recall him not before his hour.\'\r\n  So spake my Master. Then his hands he swung                      130\r\n    Downward and seized my Leader in all haste--\r\n    Hands in whose grip even Hercules once was wrung.\r\n  And Virgil when he felt them round him cast\r\n    Said: \'That I may embrace thee, hither tend,\'\r\n    And in one bundle with him made me fast.\r\n  And as to him that under Carisend[796]\r\n    Stands on the side it leans to, while clouds fly\r\n    Counter its slope, the tower appears to bend;\r\n  Even so to me who stood attentive by\r\n    Ant\xc3\xa6us seemed to stoop, and I, dismayed,                       140\r\n    Had gladly sought another road to try.\r\n  But us in the abyss he gently laid,\r\n    Where Lucifer and Judas gulfed remain;\r\n    Nor to it thus bent downward long time stayed,\r\n  But like a ship\'s mast raised himself again.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[781] _Achilles_: The rust upon his lance had virtue to heal the wound.\r\n\r\n[782] _From that sad valley_: Leaving the Tenth and last Bolgia they\r\nclimb the inner bank of it and approach the Ninth and last Circle, which\r\nconsists of the pit of the Inferno.\r\n\r\n[783] _Roland_: Charles the Great, on his march north after defeating\r\nthe Saracens at Saragossa, left Roland to bring up his rear-guard. The\r\nenemy fell on this in superior strength, and slew the Christians almost\r\nto a man. Then Roland, mortally wounded, sat down under a tree in\r\nRoncesvalles and blew upon his famous horn a blast so loud that it was\r\nheard by Charles at a distance of several miles.--The _Chansons de\r\nGeste_ were familiarly known to Italians of all classes.\r\n\r\n[784] _Then tenderly, etc._: The wound inflicted by his reproof has been\r\nalready healed, but Virgil still behaves to Dante with more than his\r\nwonted gentleness. He will have him assured of his sympathy now that\r\nthey are about to descend into the \'lowest depth of all wickedness.\'\r\n\r\n[785] _Montereggioni_: A fortress about six miles from Siena, of which\r\nample ruins still exist. It had no central keep, but twelve towers rose\r\nfrom its circular wall like spikes from the rim of a coronet. They had\r\nbeen added by the Sienese in 1260, and so were comparatively new in\r\nDante\'s time.--As the towers stood round Montereggioni so the giants at\r\nregular intervals stand round the central pit. They have their foothold\r\nwithin the enclosing mound; and thus, to one looking at them from\r\nwithout, they are hidden by it up to their middle. As the embodiment of\r\nsuperhuman impious strength and pride they stand for warders of the\r\nutmost reach of Hell.\r\n\r\n[786] _St. Peter\'s cone_: The great pine cone of bronze, supposed to\r\nhave originally crowned the mausoleum of Hadrian, lay in Dante\'s time in\r\nthe forecourt of St Peter\'s. When the new church was built it was\r\nremoved to the gardens of the Vatican, where it still remains. Its size,\r\nit will be seen, is of importance as helping us to a notion of the\r\nstature of the giants; and, though the accounts of its height are\r\nstrangely at variance with one another, I think the measurement made\r\nspecially for Philalethes may be accepted as substantially correct.\r\nAccording to that, the cone is ten palms long--about six feet. Allowing\r\nsomething for the neck, down to \'where a man clasps his cloak\' (line\r\n66), and taking the thirty palms as eighteen feet, we get twenty-six\r\nfeet or so for half his height. The giants vary in bulk; whether they do\r\nso in height is not clear. We cannot be far mistaken if we assume them\r\nto stand from fifty to sixty feet high. Virgil and Dante must throw\r\ntheir heads well back to look up into the giant\'s face; and Virgil must\r\nraise his voice as he speaks.--With regard to the height of the cone it\r\nmay be remarked that Murray\'s Handbook for Rome makes it eleven feet\r\nhigh; Gsell-Fels two and a half metres, or eight feet and three inches.\r\nIt is so placed as to be difficult of measurement.\r\n\r\n[787] _Three Frisians_: Three very tall men, as Dante took Frisians to\r\nbe, if standing one on the head of the other would not have reached his\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n[788] _Rafel, etc._: These words, like the opening line of the Seventh\r\nCanto, have, to no result, greatly exercised the ingenuity of scholars.\r\nFrom what follows it is clear that Dante meant them to be meaningless.\r\nPart of Nimrod\'s punishment is that he who brought about the confusion\r\nof tongues is now left with a language all to himself. It seems strange\r\nthat commentators should have exhausted themselves in searching for a\r\nsense in words specially invented to have none.--In his _De Vulg. El._,\r\ni. 7, Dante enlarges upon the confusion of tongues, and speaks of the\r\ntower of Babel as having been begun by men on the persuasion of a giant.\r\n\r\n[789] _Ephialtes_: One of the giants who in the war with the gods piled\r\nOssa on Pelion.\r\n\r\n[790] _Ant\xc3\xa6us_: Is to be asked to lift them over the wall, because,\r\nunlike Nimrod, he can understand what is said to him, and, unlike\r\nEphialtes, is not bound. Ant\xc3\xa6us is free-handed because he took no part\r\nin the war with the gods.\r\n\r\n[791] _The one thou\'dst see_: Briareus. Virgil here gives Dante to know\r\nwhat is the truth about Briareus (see line 97, etc.). He is not, as he\r\nwas fabled, a monster with a hundred hands, but is like Ephialtes, only\r\nfiercer to see. Hearing himself thus made light of Ephialtes trembles\r\nwith anger, like a tower rocking in an earthquake.\r\n\r\n[792] _Five ell_: Five ells make about thirty palms, so that Ant\xc3\xa6us is\r\nof the same stature as that assigned to Nimrod at line 65. This supports\r\nthe view that the \'huger\' of line 84 may apply to breadth rather than to\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n[793] _The fortune-haunted dell_: The valley of the Bagrada near Utica,\r\nwhere Scipio defeated Hannibal and won the surname of Africanus. The\r\ngiant Ant\xc3\xa6us had, according to the legend, lived in that neighbourhood,\r\nwith the flesh of lions for his food and his dwelling in a cave. He was\r\nson of the Earth, and could not be vanquished so long as he was able to\r\ntouch the ground; and thus ere Hercules could give him a mortal hug he\r\nneeded to swing him aloft. In the _Monarchia_, ii. 10, Dante refers to\r\nthe combat between Hercules and Ant\xc3\xa6us as an instance of the wager of\r\nbattle corresponding to that between David and Goliath. Lucan\'s\r\n_Pharsalia_, a favourite authority with Dante, supplies him with these\r\nreferences to Scipio and Ant\xc3\xa6us.\r\n\r\n[794] _Cocytus_: The frozen lake fed by the waters of Phlegethon. See\r\nCanto xiv. at the end.\r\n\r\n[795] _Tityus, etc._: These were other giants, stated by Lucan to be\r\nless strong than Ant\xc3\xa6us. This introduction of their names is therefore a\r\npiece of flattery to the monster. A light contemptuous turn is given by\r\nVirgil to his flattery when in the following sentence he bids Ant\xc3\xa6us not\r\ncurl his snout, but at once comply with the demand for aid. There is\r\nsomething genuinely Italian in the picture given of the giants in this\r\nCanto, as of creatures whose intellect bears no proportion to their bulk\r\nand brute strength. Mighty hunters like Nimrod, skilled in sounding the\r\nhorn but feeble in reasoned speech, Frisians with great thews and long\r\nof limb, and German men-at-arms who traded in their rude valour, to the\r\nsubtle Florentine in whom the ferment of the Renaissance was beginning\r\nto work were all specimens of Nature\'s handicraft that had better have\r\nbeen left unmade, were it not that wiser people could use them as tools.\r\n\r\n[796] _Carisenda_: A tower still standing in Bologna, built at the\r\nbeginning of the twelfth century, and, like many others of its kind in\r\nthe city, erected not for strength but merely in order to dignify the\r\nfamily to whom it belonged. By way of further distinction to their\r\nowners, some of these towers were so constructed as to lean from the\r\nperpendicular. Carisenda, like its taller neighbour the Asinelli, still\r\nsupplies a striking feature to the near and distant views of Bologna.\r\nWhat is left of it hangs for more than two yards off the plumb. In the\r\nhalf-century after Dante\'s time it had, according to Benvenuto, lost\r\nsomething of its height. It would therefore as the poet saw it seem to\r\nbe bending down even more than it now does to any one standing under it\r\non the side it slopes to, when a cloud is drifting over it in the other\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Had I sonorous rough rhymes at command,\r\n    Such as would suit the cavern terrible\r\n    Rooted on which all the other ramparts stand,\r\n  The sap of fancies which within me swell\r\n    Closer I\'d press; but since I have not these,\r\n    With some misgiving I go on to tell.\r\n  For \'tis no task to play with as you please,\r\n    Of all the world the bottom to portray,\r\n    Nor one that with a baby speech[797] agrees.\r\n  But let those ladies help me with my lay                          10\r\n    Who helped Amphion[798] walls round Thebes to pile,\r\n    And faithful to the facts my words shall stay.\r\n  O \'bove all creatures wretched, for whose vile\r\n    Abode \'tis hard to find a language fit,\r\n    As sheep or goats ye had been happier! While\r\n  We still were standing in the murky pit--\r\n    Beneath the giant\'s feet[799] set far below--\r\n    And at the high wall I was staring yet,\r\n  When this I heard: \'Heed to thy steps[800] bestow,\r\n    Lest haply by thy soles the heads be spurned                    20\r\n    Of wretched brothers wearied in their woe.\'\r\n  Before me, as on hearing this I turned,\r\n    Beneath my feet a frozen lake,[801] its guise\r\n    Rather of glass than water, I discerned.\r\n  In all its course on Austrian Danube lies\r\n    No veil in time of winter near so thick,\r\n    Nor on the Don beneath its frigid skies,\r\n  As this was here; on which if Tabernicch[802]\r\n    Or Mount Pietrapana[803] should alight\r\n    Not even the edge would answer with a creak.                    30\r\n  And as the croaking frog holds well in sight\r\n    Its muzzle from the pool, what time of year[804]\r\n    The peasant girl of gleaning dreams at night;\r\n  The mourning shades in ice were covered here,\r\n    Seen livid up to where we blush[805] with shame.\r\n    In stork-like music their teeth chattering were.\r\n  With downcast face stood every one of them:\r\n    To cold from every mouth, and to despair\r\n    From every eye, an ample witness came.\r\n  And having somewhat gazed around me there                         40\r\n    I to my feet looked down, and saw two pressed\r\n    So close together, tangled was their hair,\r\n  \'Say, who are you with breast[806] thus strained to breast?\'\r\n    I asked; whereon their necks they backward bent,\r\n    And when their upturned faces lay at rest\r\n  Their eyes, which earlier were but moistened, sent\r\n    Tears o\'er their eyelids: these the frost congealed\r\n    And fettered fast[807] before they further went.\r\n  Plank set to plank no rivet ever held\r\n    More firmly; wherefore, goat-like, either ghost                 50\r\n    Butted the other; so their wrath prevailed.\r\n  And one who wanted both ears, which the frost\r\n    Had bitten off, with face still downward thrown,\r\n    Asked: \'Why with us art thou so long engrossed?\r\n  If who that couple are thou\'dst have made known--\r\n    The vale down which Bisenzio\'s floods decline\r\n    Was once their father Albert\'s[808] and their own.\r\n  One body bore them: search the whole malign\r\n    Ca\xc3\xafna,[809] and thou shalt not any see\r\n    More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;                            60\r\n  Not he whose breast and shadow equally\r\n    Were by one thrust of Arthur\'s lance[810] pierced through:\r\n    Nor yet Focaccia;[811] nor the one that me\r\n  With his head hampers, blocking out my view,\r\n    Whose name was Sassol Mascheroni:[812] well\r\n    Thou must him know if thou art Tuscan too.\r\n  And that thou need\'st not make me further tell--\r\n    I\'m Camicion de\' Pazzi,[813] and Carlin[814]\r\n    I weary for, whose guilt shall mine excel.\'\r\n  A thousand faces saw I dog-like grin,                             70\r\n    Frost-bound; whence I, as now, shall always shake\r\n    Whenever sight of frozen pools I win.\r\n  While to the centre[815] we our way did make\r\n    To which all things converging gravitate,\r\n    And me that chill eternal caused to quake;\r\n  Whether by fortune, providence, or fate,\r\n    I know not, but as \'mong the heads I went\r\n    I kicked one full in the face; who therefore straight\r\n  \'Why trample on me?\' snarled and made lament,\r\n    \'Unless thou com\'st to heap the vengeance high                  80\r\n    For Montaperti,[816] why so virulent\r\n  \'Gainst me?\' I said: \'Await me here till I\r\n    By him, O Master, shall be cleared of doubt;[817]\r\n    Then let my pace thy will be guided by.\'\r\n  My Guide delayed, and I to him spake out,\r\n    While he continued uttering curses shrill:\r\n    \'Say, what art thou, at others thus to shout?\'\r\n  \'But who art thou, that goest at thy will\r\n    Through Antenora,[818] trampling on the face\r\n    Of others? \'Twere too much if thou wert still                   90\r\n  In life.\' \'I live, and it may help thy case,\'\r\n    Was my reply, \'if thou renown wouldst gain,\r\n    Should I thy name[819] upon my tablets place.\'\r\n  And he: \'I for the opposite am fain.\r\n    Depart thou hence, nor work me further dool;\r\n    Within this swamp thou flatterest all in vain.\'\r\n  Then I began him by the scalp to pull,\r\n    And \'Thou must tell how thou art called,\' I said,\r\n    \'Or soon thy hair will not be plentiful.\'\r\n  And he: \'Though every hair thou from me shred                    100\r\n    I will not tell thee, nor my face turn round;\r\n    No, though a thousand times thou spurn my head.\'\r\n  His locks ere this about my fist were wound,\r\n    And many a tuft I tore, while dog-like wails\r\n    Burst from him, and his eyes still sought the ground.\r\n  Then called another: \'Bocca, what now ails?\r\n    Is\'t not enough thy teeth go chattering there,\r\n    But thou must bark? What devil thee assails?\'\r\n  \'Ah! now,\' said I, \'thou need\'st not aught declare,\r\n    Accursed traitor; and true news of thee                        110\r\n    To thy disgrace I to the world will bear.\'\r\n  \'Begone, tell what thou wilt,\' he answered me;\r\n    \'But, if thou issue hence, not silent keep[820]\r\n    Of him whose tongue but lately wagged so free.\r\n  He for the Frenchmen\'s money[821] here doth weep.\r\n    Him of Duera saw I, mayst thou tell,\r\n    Where sinners shiver in the frozen deep.\r\n  Shouldst thou be asked who else within it dwell--\r\n    Thou hast the Beccheria[822] at thy side;\r\n    Across whose neck the knife at Florence fell.                  120\r\n  John Soldanieri[823] may be yonder spied\r\n    With Ganellon,[824] and Tribaldell[825] who threw\r\n    Faenza\'s gates, when slept the city, wide.\'\r\n  Him had we left, our journey to pursue,\r\n    When frozen in a hole[826] a pair I saw;\r\n    One\'s head like the other\'s hat showed to the view.\r\n  And, as their bread men hunger-driven gnaw,\r\n    The uppermost tore fiercely at his mate\r\n    Where nape and brain-pan to a junction draw.\r\n  No worse by Tydeus[827] in his scornful hate                     130\r\n    Were Menalippus\' temples gnawed and hacked\r\n    Than skull and all were torn by him irate.\r\n  \'O thou who provest by such bestial act\r\n    Hatred of him who by thy teeth is chewed,\r\n    Declare thy motive,\' said I, \'on this pact--\r\n  That if with reason thou with him hast feud,\r\n    Knowing your names and manner of his crime\r\n    I in the world[828] to thee will make it good;\r\n  If what I speak with dry not ere the time.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[797] _A baby speech_: \'A tongue that cries _mamma_ and _papa_\' For his\r\npresent purpose, he complains, he has not in Italian an adequate supply\r\nof rough high-sounding rhymes; but at least he will use only the best\r\nwords that can be found. In another work (_De Vulg. El._ ii. 7) he\r\ninstances _mamma_ and _babbo_ as words of a kind to be avoided by all\r\nwho would write nobly in Italian.\r\n\r\n[798] _Amphion_: Who with his music charmed rocks from the mountain and\r\nheaped them in order for walls to Thebes.\r\n\r\n[799] _The giant\'s feet_: Ant\xc3\xa6us. A bank slopes from where the giants\r\nstand inside the wall down to the pit which is filled with the frozen\r\nCocytus. This is the Ninth and inmost Circle, and is divided into four\r\nconcentric rings--Ca\xc3\xafna, Antenora, Ptolom\xc3\xa6a, and Judecca--where traitors\r\nof different kinds are punished.\r\n\r\n[800] _Thy steps_: Dante alone is addressed, the speaker having seen him\r\nset heavily down upon the ice by Ant\xc3\xa6us.\r\n\r\n[801] _A frozen lake_: Cocytus. See _Inf._ xiv. 119.\r\n\r\n[802] _Tabernicch_: It is not certain what mountain is here meant;\r\nprobably Yavornick near Adelsberg in Carniola. It is mentioned, not for\r\nits size, but the harshness of its name.\r\n\r\n[803] _Pietrapana_: A mountain between Modena and Lucca, visible from\r\nPisa: Petra Apuana.\r\n\r\n[804] _Time of year_: At harvest-time, when in the warm summer nights\r\nthe wearied gleaner dreams of her day\'s work.\r\n\r\n[805] _To where we blush_: The bodies of the shades are seen buried in\r\nthe clear glassy ice, out of which their heads and necks stand free--as\r\nmuch as \'shows shame,\' that is, blushes.\r\n\r\n[806] _With breast, etc._: As could be seen through the clear ice.\r\n\r\n[807] _Fettered fast_: Binding up their eyes. In the punishment of\r\ntraitors is symbolised the hardness and coldness of their hearts to all\r\nthe claims of blood, country, or friendship.\r\n\r\n[808] _Their father Albert\'s_: Albert, of the family of the Counts\r\nAlberti, lord of the upper valley of the Bisenzio, near Florence. His\r\nsons, Alexander and Napoleon, slew one another in a quarrel regarding\r\ntheir inheritance.\r\n\r\n[809] _Ca\xc3\xafna_: The outer ring of the Ninth Circle, and that in which are\r\npunished those treacherous to their kindred.--Here a place is reserved\r\nfor Gianciotto Malatesta, the husband of Francesca (_Inf._ v. 107).\r\n\r\n[810] _Arthur\'s lance_: Mordred, natural son of King Arthur, was slain\r\nby him in battle as a rebel and traitor. \'And the history says that\r\nafter the lance-thrust Girflet plainly saw a ray of the sun pass through\r\nthe hole of the wound.\'--_Lancelot du Lac_.\r\n\r\n[811] _Focaccia_: A member of the Pistoiese family of Cancellieri, in\r\nwhose domestic feuds the parties of Whites and Blacks took rise. He\r\nassassinated one of his relatives and cut off the hand of another.\r\n\r\n[812] _Sassol Mascheroni_: Of the Florentine family of the Toschi. He\r\nmurdered his nephew, of whom by some accounts he was the guardian. For\r\nthis crime he was punished by being rolled through the streets of\r\nFlorence in a cask and then beheaded. Every Tuscan would be familiar\r\nwith the story of such a punishment.\r\n\r\n[813] _Camicion de\' Pazzi_: To distinguish the Pazzi to whom Camicione\r\nbelonged from the Pazzi of Florence they were called the Pazzi of\r\nValdarno, where their possessions lay. Like his fellow-traitors he had\r\nslain a kinsman.\r\n\r\n[814] _Carlin_: Also one of the Pazzi of Valdarno. Like all the spirits\r\nin this circle Camicione is eager to betray the treachery of others, and\r\nprophesies the guilt of his still living relative, which is to cast his\r\nown villany into the shade. In 1302 or 1303 Carlino held the castle of\r\nPiano de Trevigne in Valdarno, where many of the exiled Whites of\r\nFlorence had taken refuge, and for a bribe he betrayed it to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[815] _The centre_: The bottom of Inferno is the centre of the earth,\r\nand, on the system of Ptolemy, the central point of the universe.\r\n\r\n[816] _Montaperti_: See _Inf._ x. 86. The speaker is Bocca, of the great\r\nFlorentine family of the Abati, who served as one of the Florentine\r\ncavaliers at Montaperti. When the enemy was charging towards the\r\nstandard of the Republican cavalry Bocca aimed a blow at the arm of the\r\nknight who bore it and cut off his hand. The sudden fall of the flag\r\ndisheartened the Florentines, and in great measure contributed to the\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n[817] _Cleared of doubt_: The mention of Montaperti in this place of\r\ntraitors suggests to Dante the thought of Bocca. He would fain be sure\r\nas to whether he has the traitor at his feet. Montaperti was never very\r\nfar from the thoughts of the Florentine of that day. It is never out of\r\nBocca\'s mind.\r\n\r\n[818] _Antenora_: The second ring of the Ninth Circle, where traitors to\r\ntheir country are punished, named after Antenor the Trojan prince who,\r\naccording to the belief of the middle ages, betrayed his native city to\r\nthe Greeks.\r\n\r\n[819] _Should I thy name, etc._: \'Should I put thy name among the other\r\nnotes.\' It is the last time that Dante is to offer such a bribe; and\r\nhere the offer is most probably ironical.\r\n\r\n[820] _Not silent keep, etc._: Like all the other traitors Bocca finds\r\nhis only pleasure in betraying his neighbours.\r\n\r\n[821] _The Frenchmen\'s money_: He who had betrayed the name of Bocca was\r\nBuoso of Duera, one of the Ghibeline chiefs of Cremona. When Guy of\r\nMontfort was leading an army across Lombardy to recruit Charles of Anjou\r\nin his war against Manfred in 1265 (_Inf._ xxviii. 16 and _Purg._ iii.),\r\nBuoso, who had been left to guard the passage of the Oglio, took a bribe\r\nto let the French army pass.\r\n\r\n[822] _Beccheria_: Tesauro of the Pavian family Beccheria, Abbot of\r\nVallombrosa and legate in Florence of Pope Alexander IV. He was accused\r\nof conspiring against the Commonwealth along with the exiled Ghibelines\r\n(1258). All Europe was shocked to hear that a great churchman had been\r\ntortured and beheaded by the Florentines. The city was placed under\r\nPapal interdict, proclaimed by the Archbishop of Pisa from the tower of\r\nS. Pietro in Vincoli at Rome. Villani seems to think the Abbot was\r\ninnocent of the charge brought against him (_Cron._ vi. 65), but he\r\nalways leans to the indulgent view when a priest is concerned.\r\n\r\n[823] _Soldanieri_: Deserted from the Florentine Ghibelines after the\r\ndefeat of Manfred.\r\n\r\n[824] _Ganellon_: Whose treacherous counsel led to the defeat of Roland\r\nat Roncesvalles.\r\n\r\n[825] _Tribaldello_: A noble of Faenza, who, as one account says, to\r\nrevenge himself for the loss of a pig, sent a cast of the key of the\r\ncity gate to John of Apia, then prowling about Romagna in the interest\r\nof the French Pope, Martin IV. He was slain at the battle of Forl\xc3\xac in\r\n1282 (_Inf._ xxvii. 43).\r\n\r\n[826] _Frozen in a hole, etc._: The two are the Count Ugolino and the\r\nArchbishop Roger.\r\n\r\n[827] _Tydeus_: One of the Seven against Thebes, who, having been\r\nmortally wounded by Menalippus the Theban, whom he slew, got his friends\r\nto bring him the head of his foe and gnawed at it with his teeth. Dante\r\nfound the incident in his favourite author Statius (_Theb._ viii.).\r\n\r\n[828] _I in the world, etc._: Dante has learned from Bocca that the\r\nprospect of having their memory refreshed on earth has no charm for the\r\nsinners met with here. The bribe he offers is that of loading the name\r\nof a foe with ignominy--but only if from the tale it shall be plain that\r\nthe ignominy is deserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n  His mouth uplifting from the savage feast,\r\n    The sinner[829] rubbed and wiped it free of gore\r\n    On the hair of the head he from behind laid waste;\r\n  And then began: \'Thou\'dst have me wake once more\r\n    A desperate grief, of which to think alone,\r\n    Ere I have spoken, wrings me to the core.\r\n  But if my words shall be as seed that sown\r\n    May fructify unto the traitor\'s shame\r\n    Whom thus I gnaw, I mingle speech[830] and groan.\r\n  Of how thou earnest hither or thy name                            10\r\n    I nothing know, but that a Florentine[831]\r\n    In very sooth thou art, thy words proclaim.\r\n  Thou then must know I was Count Ugolin,\r\n    The Archbishop Roger[832] he. Now hearken well\r\n    Why I prove such a neighbour. How in fine,\r\n  And flowing from his ill designs, it fell\r\n    That I, confiding in his words, was caught\r\n    Then done to death, were waste of time[833] to tell.\r\n  But that of which as yet thou heardest nought\r\n    Is how the death was cruel which I met:                         20\r\n    Hearken and judge if wrong to me he wrought.\r\n  Scant window in the mew whose epithet\r\n    Of Famine[834] came from me its resident,\r\n    And cooped in which shall many languish yet,\r\n  Had shown me through its slit how there were spent\r\n    Full many moons,[835] ere that bad dream I dreamed\r\n    When of my future was the curtain rent.\r\n  Lord of the hunt and master this one seemed,\r\n    Chasing the wolf and wolf-cubs on the height[836]\r\n    By which from Pisan eyes is Lucca hemmed.                       30\r\n  With famished hounds well trained and swift of flight,\r\n    Lanfranchi[837] and Gualandi in the van,\r\n    And Sismond he had set. Within my sight\r\n  Both sire and sons--nor long the chase--began\r\n    To grow (so seemed it) weary as they fled;\r\n    Then through their flanks fangs sharp and eager ran.\r\n  When I awoke before the morning spread\r\n    I heard my sons[838] all weeping in their sleep--\r\n    For they were with me--and they asked for bread.\r\n  Ah! cruel if thou canst from pity keep                            40\r\n    At the bare thought of what my heart foreknew;\r\n    And if thou weep\'st not, what could make thee weep?\r\n  Now were they \'wake, and near the moment drew\r\n    At which \'twas used to bring us our repast;\r\n    But each was fearful[839] lest his dream came true.\r\n  And then I heard the under gate[840] made fast\r\n    Of the horrible tower, and thereupon I gazed\r\n    In my sons\' faces, silent and aghast.\r\n  I did not weep, for I to stone was dazed:\r\n    They wept, and darling Anselm me besought:                      50\r\n    "What ails thee, father? Wherefore thus amazed?"\r\n  And yet I did not weep, and answered not\r\n    The whole day, and that night made answer none,\r\n    Till on the world another sun shone out.\r\n  Soon as a feeble ray of light had won\r\n    Into our doleful prison, made aware\r\n    Of the four faces[841] featured like my own,\r\n  Both of my hands I bit at in despair;\r\n    And they, imagining that I was fain\r\n    To eat, arose before me with the prayer:                        60\r\n  "O father, \'twere for us an easier pain\r\n    If thou wouldst eat us. Thou didst us array\r\n    In this poor flesh: unclothe us now again."\r\n  I calmed me, not to swell their woe. That day\r\n    And the next day no single word we said.\r\n    Ah! pitiless earth, that didst unyawning stay!\r\n  When we had reached the fourth day, Gaddo, spread\r\n    Out at my feet, fell prone; and made demand:\r\n    "Why, O my father, offering us no aid?"\r\n  There died he. Plain as I before thee stand                       70\r\n    I saw the three as one by one they failed,\r\n    The fifth day and the sixth; then with my hand,\r\n  Blind now, I groped for each of them, and wailed\r\n    On them for two days after they were gone.\r\n    Famine[842] at last, more strong than grief, prevailed,\'\r\n  When he had uttered this, his eyes all thrown\r\n    Awry, upon the hapless skull he fell\r\n    With teeth that, dog-like, rasped upon the bone.\r\n  Ah, Pisa! byword of the folk that dwell\r\n    In the sweet country where the Si[843] doth sound,              80\r\n    Since slow thy neighbours to reward thee well\r\n  Let now Gorgona and Capraia[844] mound\r\n    Themselves where Arno with the sea is blent,\r\n    Till every one within thy walls be drowned.\r\n  For though report of Ugolino went\r\n    That he betrayed[845] thy castles, thou didst wrong\r\n    Thus cruelly his children to torment.\r\n  These were not guilty, for they were but young,\r\n    Thou modern Thebes![846] Brigata and young Hugh,\r\n    And the other twain of whom above \'tis sung.                    90\r\n  We onward passed to where another crew[847]\r\n    Of shades the thick-ribbed ice doth fettered keep;\r\n    Their heads not downward these, but backward threw.\r\n  Their very weeping will not let them weep,\r\n    And grief, encountering barriers at their eyes,\r\n    Swells, flowing inward, their affliction deep;\r\n  For the first tears that issue crystallise,\r\n    And fill, like vizor fashioned out of glass,\r\n    The hollow cup o\'er which the eyebrows rise.\r\n  And though, as \'twere a callus, now my face                      100\r\n    By reason of the frost was wholly grown\r\n    Benumbed and dead to feeling, I could trace\r\n  (So it appeared), a breeze against it blown,\r\n    And asked: \'O Master, whence comes this? So low\r\n    As where we are is any vapour[848] known?\'\r\n  And he replied: \'Thou ere long while shalt go\r\n    Where touching this thine eye shall answer true,\r\n    Discovering that which makes the wind to blow.\'\r\n  Then from the cold crust one of that sad crew\r\n    Demanded loud: \'Spirits, for whom they hold                    110\r\n    The inmost room, so truculent were you,\r\n  Back from my face let these hard veils be rolled,\r\n    That I may vent the woe which chokes my heart,\r\n    Ere tears again solidify with cold.\'\r\n  And I to him: \'First tell me who thou art\r\n    If thou\'dst have help; then if I help not quick\r\n    To the bottom[849] of the ice let me depart.\'\r\n  He answered: \'I am Friar Alberic[850]--\r\n    He of the fruit grown in the orchard fell--\r\n    And here am I repaid with date for fig.\'                       120\r\n  \'Ah!\' said I to him, \'art thou dead as well?\'\r\n    \'How now my body fares,\' he answered me,\r\n    \'Up in the world, I have no skill to tell;\r\n  For Ptolom\xc3\xa6a[851] has this quality--\r\n    The soul oft plunges hither to its place\r\n    Ere it has been by Atropos[852] set free.\r\n  And that more willingly from off my face\r\n    Thou mayst remove the glassy tears, know, soon\r\n    As ever any soul of man betrays\r\n  As I betrayed, the body once his own                             130\r\n    A demon takes and governs until all\r\n    The span allotted for his life be run.\r\n  Into this tank headlong the soul doth fall;\r\n    And on the earth his body yet may show\r\n    Whose shade behind me wintry frosts enthral.\r\n  But thou canst tell, if newly come below:\r\n    It is Ser Branca d\'Oria,[853] and complete\r\n    Is many a year since he was fettered so.\'\r\n  \'It seems,\' I answered, \'that thou wouldst me cheat,\r\n    For Branca d\'Oria never can have died:                         140\r\n    He sleeps, puts clothes on, swallows drink and meat.\'\r\n  \'Or e\'er to the tenacious pitchy tide\r\n    Which boils in Malebranche\'s moat had come\r\n    The shade of Michael Zanche,\' he replied,\r\n  \'That soul had left a devil in its room\r\n    Within its body; of his kinsmen one[854]\r\n    Treacherous with him experienced equal doom.\r\n  But stretch thy hand and be its work begun\r\n    Of setting free mine eyes.\' This did not I.\r\n    Twas highest courtesy to yield him none.[855]                  150\r\n  Ah, Genoese,[856] strange to morality!\r\n    Ye men infected with all sorts of sin!\r\n    Out of the world \'tis time that ye should die.\r\n  Here, to Romagna\'s blackest soul[857] akin,\r\n    I chanced on one of you; for doing ill\r\n    His soul o\'erwhelmed Cocytus\' floods within,\r\n  Though in the flesh he seems surviving still.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE COUNT UGOLINO.\r\n\r\nUgolino della Gherardesca, Count of Donoratico, a wealthy noble and a\r\nman fertile in political resource, was deeply engaged in the affairs of\r\nPisa at a critical period of her history. He was born in the first half\r\nof the thirteenth century. By giving one of his daughters in marriage to\r\nthe head of the Visconti of Pisa--not to be confounded with those of\r\nMilan--he came under the suspicion of being Guelf in his sympathies; the\r\ngeneral opinion of Pisa being then, as it always had been, strongly\r\nGhibeline. When driven into exile, as he was along with the Visconti, he\r\nimproved the occasion by entering into close relations with the leading\r\nGuelfs of Tuscany, and in 1278 a free return for him to Pisa was made by\r\nthem a condition of peace with that city. He commanded one of the\r\ndivisions of the Pisan fleet at the disastrous battle of Meloria in\r\n1284, when Genoa wrested from her rival the supremacy of the Western\r\nMediterranean, and carried thousands of Pisan citizens into a captivity\r\nwhich lasted many years. Isolated from her Ghibeline allies, and for the\r\ntime almost sunk in despair, the city called him to the government with\r\nwellnigh dictatorial powers; and by dint of crafty negotiations in\r\ndetail with the members of the league formed against Pisa, helped as was\r\nbelieved by lavish bribery, he had the glory of saving the Commonwealth\r\nfrom destruction though he could not wholly save it from loss. This was\r\nin 1285. He soon came to be suspected of being in a secret alliance with\r\nFlorence and of being lukewarm in the negotiations for the return of the\r\nprisoners in Genoa, all with a view to depress the Ghibeline element in\r\nthe city that he might establish himself as an absolute tyrant with the\r\ngreater ease. In order still further to strengthen his position he\r\nentered into a family compact with his Guelf grandson Nino (_Purg._\r\nviii. 53), now at the head of the Visconti. But without the support of\r\nthe people it was impossible for him to hold his ground against the\r\nGhibeline nobles, who resented the arrogance of his manners and were\r\nembittered by the loss of their own share in the government; and these\r\ncontrived that month by month the charges of treachery brought against\r\nhim should increase in virulence. He had, by deserting his post, caused\r\nthe defeat at Meloria, it was said; and had bribed the other Tuscan\r\ncities to favour him, by ceding to them distant Pisan strongholds. His\r\nfate was sealed when, having quarrelled with his grandson Nino, he\r\nsought alliance with the Archbishop Roger who now led the Ghibeline\r\nopposition. With Ugo\'s connivance an onslaught was planned upon the\r\nGuelfs. To preserve an appearance of impartiality he left the city for a\r\nneighbouring villa. On returning to enjoy his riddance from a rival he\r\nwas invited to a conference, at which he resisted a proposal that he\r\nshould admit partners with him in the government. On this the\r\nArchbishop\'s party raised the cry of treachery; the bells rang out for a\r\nstreet battle, in which he was worsted; and with his sons he had to take\r\nrefuge in the Palace of the People. There he stood a short siege against\r\nthe Ghibeline families and the angry mob; and in the same palace he was\r\nkept prisoner for twenty days. Then, with his sons and grandsons, he was\r\ncarried in chains to the tower of the Gualandi, which stood where seven\r\nways met in the heart of Pisa. This was in July 1288. The imprisonment\r\nlasted for months, and seems to have been thus prolonged with the view\r\nof extorting a heavy ransom. It was only in the following March that the\r\nArchbishop ordered his victims to be starved to death; for, being a\r\nchurchman, says one account, he would not shed blood. Not even a\r\nconfessor was allowed to Ugo and his sons. After the door of the tower\r\nhad been kept closed for eight days it was opened, and the corpses,\r\nstill fettered, were huddled into a tomb in the Franciscan church.--The\r\noriginal authorities are far from being agreed as to the details of\r\nUgo\'s overthrow and death.--For the matter of this note I am chiefly\r\nindebted to the careful epitome of the Pisan history of that time by\r\nPhilalethes in his note on this Canto (_G\xc3\xb6ttliche Com\xc3\xb6die_).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[829] _The sinner_: Count Ugolino. See note at the end of the Canto.\r\n\r\n[830] _Mingle speech, etc._: A comparison of these words with those of\r\nFrancesca (_Inf._ v. 124) will show the difference in moral tone between\r\nthe Second Circle of Inferno and the Ninth.\r\n\r\n[831] _A Florentine_: So Farinata (_Inf._ x. 25) recognises Dante by his\r\nFlorentine speech. The words heard by Ugo are those at xxxii. 133.\r\n\r\n[832] _The Archbishop Roger_: Ruggieri, of the Tuscan family of the\r\nUbaldini, to which the Cardinal of _Inf._ x. 120 also belonged. Towards\r\nthe end of his life he was summoned to Rome to give an account of his\r\nevil deeds, and on his refusal to go was declared a rebel to the Church.\r\nUgolino was a traitor to his country; Roger, having entered into some\r\nsort of alliance with Ugolino, was a traitor to him. This has led some\r\nto suppose that while Ugolino is in Antenora he is so close to the edge\r\nof it as to be able to reach the head of Roger, who, as a traitor to his\r\nfriend, is fixed in Ptolom\xc3\xa6a. Against this view is the fact that they\r\nare described as being in the same hole (xxxii. 125), and also that in\r\nPtolom\xc3\xa6a the shades are set with head thrown back, and with only the\r\nface appearing above the ice, while Ugo is described as biting his foe\r\nat where the skull joins the nape. From line 91 it is clear that\r\nPtolom\xc3\xa6a lay further on than where Roger is. Like Ugo he is therefore\r\nhere as a traitor to his country.\r\n\r\n[833] _Were waste, etc._: For Dante knows it already, all Tuscany being\r\nfamiliar with the story of Ugo\'s fate.\r\n\r\n[834] _Whose epithet of Famine_: It was called the Tower of Famine. Its\r\nsite is now built over. Buti, the old Pisan commentator of Dante, says\r\nit was called the Mew because the eagles of the Republic were kept in it\r\nat moulting-time. But this may have been an after-thought to give local\r\ntruth to Dante\'s verse, which it does at the expense of the poetry.\r\n\r\n[835] _Many moons_: The imprisonment having already lasted for eight\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[836] _The height, etc._: Lucca is about twelve miles from Pisa, Mount\r\nGiuliano rising between them.\r\n\r\n[837] _Lanfranchi, etc._: In the dream, these, the chief Ghibeline\r\nfamilies of Pisa, are the huntsmen, Roger being master of the hunt, and\r\nthe populace the hounds. Ugo and his sons and grandsons are the wolf and\r\nwolf-cubs. In Ugo\'s dream of himself as a wolf there may be an allusion\r\nto his having engaged in the Guelf interest.\r\n\r\n[838] _My sons_: According to Dante, taken literally, four of Ugo were\r\nimprisoned with him. It would have hampered him to explain that two were\r\ngrandsons--Anselmuccio and Nino, called the Brigata at line 89,\r\ngrandsons by their mother of King Enzo, natural son of Frederick\r\nII.--the sons being Gaddo and Uguccione, the latter Ugo\'s youngest son.\r\n\r\n[839] _Each was fearful, etc._: All the sons had been troubled by dreams\r\nof famine. Had their rations been already reduced?\r\n\r\n[840] _The under gate, etc._: The word translated _made fast_\r\n(_chiavare_) may signify either to nail up or to lock. The commentators\r\nand chroniclers differ as to whether the door was locked, nailed, or\r\nbuilt up. I would suggest that the lower part of the tower was occupied\r\nby a guard, and that the captives had not been used to hear the main\r\ndoor locked. Now, when they hear the great key creaking in the lock,\r\nthey know that the tower is deserted.\r\n\r\n[841] _The four faces, etc._: Despairing like his own, or possibly that,\r\nwasted by famine, the faces of the young men had become liker than ever\r\nto Ugo\'s own time-worn face.\r\n\r\n[842] _Famine, etc._: This line, quite without reason, has been held to\r\nmean that Ugo was driven by hunger to eat the flesh of his children. The\r\nmeaning is, that poignant though his grief was it did not shorten his\r\nsufferings from famine.\r\n\r\n[843] _Where the Si, etc._: Italy, _Si_ being the Italian for _Yes_.\r\nIn his _De Vulg. El._, i. 8, Dante distinguishes the Latin\r\nlanguages--French, Italian, etc.--by their words of affirmation, and so\r\nterms Italian the language of _Si_. But Tuscany may here be meant,\r\nwhere, as a Tuscan commentator says, the _Si_ is more sweetly pronounced\r\nthan in any other part of Italy. In Canto xviii. 61 the Bolognese are\r\ndistinguished as the people who say _Sipa_. If Pisa be taken as being\r\nspecially the opprobrium of Tuscany the outburst against Genoa at the\r\nclose of the Canto gains in distinctness and force.\r\n\r\n[844] _Gorgona and Capraia_: Islands not far from the mouth of the Arno.\r\n\r\n[845] _That he betrayed, etc._: Dante seems here to throw doubt on the\r\ncharge. At the height of her power Pisa was possessed of many hundreds\r\nof fortified stations in Italy and scattered over the Mediterranean\r\ncoasts. The charge was one easy to make and difficult to refute. It\r\nseems hard on Ugo that he should get the benefit of the doubt only after\r\nhe has been, for poetical ends, buried raging in Cocytus.\r\n\r\n[846] _Modern Thebes_: As Thebes was to the race of Cadmus, so was Pisa\r\nto that of Ugolino.\r\n\r\n[847] _Another crew_: They are in Ptolom\xc3\xa6a, the third division of the\r\ncircle, and that assigned to those treacherous to their friends, allies,\r\nor guests. Here only the faces of the shades are free of the ice.\r\n\r\n[848] _Is any vapour_: Has the sun, so low down as this, any influence\r\nupon the temperature, producing vapours and wind? In Dante\'s time wind\r\nwas believed to be the exhalation of a vapour.\r\n\r\n[849] _To the bottom, etc._: Dante is going there in any case, and his\r\npromise is nothing but a quibble.\r\n\r\n[850] _Friar Alberic_: Alberigo of the Manfredi, a gentleman of Faenza,\r\nwho late in life became one of the Merry Friars. See _Inf._ xxiii. 103.\r\nIn the course of a dispute with his relative Manfred he got a hearty box\r\non the ear from him. Feigning to have forgiven the insult he invited\r\nManfred with a youthful son to dinner in his house, having first\r\narranged that when they had finished their meat, and he called for\r\nfruit, armed men should fall on his guests. \'The fruit of Friar\r\nAlberigo\' passed into a proverb. Here he is repaid with a date for a\r\nfig--gets more than he bargained for.\r\n\r\n[851] _Ptolom\xc3\xa6a_: This division is named from the Hebrew Ptolemy, who\r\nslew his relatives at a banquet, they being then his guests (1 Maccab.\r\nxvi.).\r\n\r\n[852] _Atropos_: The Fate who cuts the thread of life and sets the soul\r\nfree from the body.\r\n\r\n[853] _Branca d\'Oria_: A Genoese noble who in 1275 slew his\r\nfather-in-law Michael Zanche (_Inf._ xxii. 88) while the victim sat at\r\ntable as his invited guest.--This mention of Branca is of some value in\r\nhelping to ascertain when the _Inferno_ was finished. He was in\r\nimprisonment and exile for some time before and up to 1310. In 1311 he\r\nwas one of the citizens of Genoa heartiest in welcoming the Emperor\r\nHenry to their city. Impartial as Dante was, we can scarcely think that\r\nhe would have loaded with infamy one who had done what he could to help\r\nthe success of Henry, on whom all Dante\'s hopes were long set, and by\r\ntheir reception of whom on his descent into Italy he continued to judge\r\nhis fellow-countrymen. There is considerable reason to believe that the\r\n_Inferno_ was published in 1309; this introduction of Branca helps to\r\nprove that at least it was published before 1311. If this was so, then\r\nBranca d\'Oria lived long enough to read or hear that for thirty-five\r\nyears his soul had been in Hell.--It is significant of the detestation\r\nin which Dante held any breach of hospitality, that it is as a\r\ntreacherous host and not as a treacherous kinsman that Branca is\r\npunished--in Ptolom\xc3\xa6a and not in Ca\xc3\xafna. Cast as the poet was on the\r\nhospitality of the world, any disloyalty to its obligations came home to\r\nhim. For such disloyalty he has invented one of the most appalling of\r\nthe fierce retributions with the vision of which he satisfied his\r\ncraving for vengeance upon prosperous sin.--It may be that the idea of\r\nthis demon-possession of the traitor is taken from the words, \'and after\r\nthe sop Satan entered into Judas.\'\r\n\r\n[854] _Of his kinsmen one_: A cousin or nephew of Branca was engaged\r\nwith him in the murder of Michael Zanche. The vengeance came on them so\r\nspeedily that their souls were plunged in Ptolom\xc3\xa6a ere Zanche breathed\r\nhis last.\r\n\r\n[855] _To yield him none_: Alberigo being so unworthy of courtesy. See\r\nnote on 117. But another interpretation of the words has been suggested\r\nwhich saves Dante from the charge of cruelty and mean quibbling; namely,\r\nthat he did not clear the ice from the sinner\'s eyes because then he\r\nwould have been seen to be a living man--one who could take back to the\r\nworld the awful news that Alberigo\'s body was the dwelling-place of a\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\n[856] _Ah, Genoese, etc._: The Genoese, indeed, held no good character.\r\nOne of their annalists, under the date of 1293, describes the city as\r\nsuffering from all kinds of crime.\r\n\r\n[857] _Romagna\'s blackest soul_: Friar Alberigo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTO XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \'_Vexilla_[858] _Regis prodeunt Inferni_\r\n    Towards where we are; seek then with vision keen,\'\r\n    My Master bade, \'if trace of him thou spy.\'\r\n  As, when the exhalations dense have been,\r\n    Or when our hemisphere grows dark with night,\r\n    A windmill from afar is sometimes seen,\r\n  I seemed to catch of such a structure sight;\r\n    And then to \'scape the blast did backward draw\r\n    Behind my Guide--sole shelter in my plight.\r\n  Now was I where[859] (I versify with awe)                         10\r\n    The shades were wholly covered, and did show\r\n    Visible as in glass are bits of straw.\r\n  Some stood[860] upright and some were lying low,\r\n    Some with head topmost, others with their feet;\r\n    And some with face to feet bent like a bow.\r\n  But we kept going on till it seemed meet\r\n    Unto my Master that I should behold\r\n    The creature once[861] of countenance so sweet.\r\n  He stepped aside and stopped me as he told:\r\n    \'Lo, Dis! And lo, we are arrived at last                        20\r\n    Where thou must nerve thee and must make thee bold,\'\r\n  How I hereon stood shivering and aghast,\r\n    Demand not, Reader; this I cannot write;\r\n    So much the fact all reach of words surpassed.\r\n  I was not dead, yet living was not quite:\r\n    Think for thyself, if gifted with the power,\r\n    What, life and death denied me, was my plight.\r\n  Of that tormented realm the Emperor\r\n    Out of the ice stood free to middle breast;\r\n    And me a giant less would overtower                             30\r\n  Than would his arm a giant. By such test\r\n    Judge then what bulk the whole of him must show,[862]\r\n    Of true proportion with such limb possessed.\r\n  If he was fair of old as hideous now,\r\n    And yet his brows against his Maker raised,\r\n    Meetly from him doth all affliction flow.\r\n  O how it made me horribly amazed\r\n    When on his head I saw three faces[863] grew!\r\n    The one vermilion which straight forward gazed;\r\n  And joining on to it were other two,                              40\r\n    One rising up from either shoulder-bone,\r\n    Till to a junction on the crest they drew.\r\n  \'Twixt white and yellow seemed the right-hand one;\r\n    The left resembled them whose country lies\r\n    Where valleywards the floods of Nile flow down.\r\n  Beneath each face two mighty wings did rise,\r\n    Such as this bird tremendous might demand:\r\n    Sails of sea-ships ne\'er saw I of such size.\r\n  Not feathered were they, but in style were planned\r\n    Like a bat\'s wing:[864] by them a threefold breeze--            50\r\n    For still he flapped them--evermore was fanned,\r\n  And through its depths Cocytus caused to freeze.\r\n    Down three chins tears for ever made descent\r\n    From his six eyes; and red foam mixed with these.\r\n  In every mouth there was a sinner rent\r\n    By teeth that shred him as a heckle[865] would;\r\n    Thus three at once compelled he to lament.\r\n  To the one in front \'twas little to be chewed\r\n    Compared with being clawed and clawed again,\r\n    Till his back-bone of skin was sometimes nude.[866]             60\r\n  \'The soul up yonder in the greater pain\r\n    Is Judas \'Scariot, with his head among\r\n    The teeth,\' my Master said, \'while outward strain\r\n  His legs. Of the two whose heads are downward hung,\r\n    Brutus is from the black jowl pendulous:\r\n    See how he writhes, yet never wags his tongue.\r\n  The other, great of thew, is Cassius:[867]\r\n    But night is rising[868] and we must be gone;\r\n    For everything hath now been seen by us.\'\r\n  Then, as he bade, I to his neck held on                           70\r\n    While he the time and place of vantage chose;\r\n    And when the wings enough were open thrown\r\n  He grasped the shaggy ribs and clutched them close,\r\n    And so from tuft to tuft he downward went\r\n    Between the tangled hair and crust which froze.\r\n  We to the bulging haunch had made descent,\r\n    To where the hip-joint lies in it; and then\r\n    My Guide, with painful twist and violent,\r\n  Turned round his head to where his feet had been,\r\n    And like a climber closely clutched the hair:                   80\r\n    I thought to Hell[869] that we returned again.\r\n  \'Hold fast to me; it needs by such a stair,\'\r\n    Panting, my Leader said, like man foredone,\r\n    \'That we from all that wretchedness repair.\'\r\n  Right through a hole in a rock when he had won,\r\n    The edge of it he gave me for a seat\r\n    And deftly then to join me clambered on.\r\n  I raised mine eyes, expecting they would meet\r\n    With Lucifer as I beheld him last,\r\n    But saw instead his upturned legs[870] and feet.                90\r\n  If in perplexity I then was cast,\r\n    Let ignorant people think who do not see\r\n    What point[871] it was that I had lately passed.\r\n  \'Rise to thy feet,\' my Master said to me;\r\n    \'The way is long and rugged the ascent,\r\n    And at mid tierce[872] the sun must almost be.\'\r\n  \'Twas not as if on palace floors we went:\r\n    A dungeon fresh from nature\'s hand was this;\r\n    Rough underfoot, and of light indigent.\r\n  \'Or ever I escape from the abyss,                                100\r\n    O Master,\' said I, standing now upright,\r\n    \'Correct in few words where I think amiss.\r\n  Where lies the ice?

The sun, how had it skill\r\n    In so short while to pass to morn from night?\'[873]\r\n  And he: \'In fancy thou art standing, still,\r\n    On yon side of the centre, where I caught\r\n    The vile worm\'s hair which through the world doth drill.\r\n  There wast thou while our downward course I wrought;\r\n    But when I turned, the centre was passed by                    110\r\n    Which by all weights from every point is sought.\r\n  And now thou standest \'neath the other sky,\r\n    Opposed to that which vaults the great dry ground\r\n    And \'neath whose summit[874] there did whilom die\r\n  The Man[875] whose birth and life were sinless found.\r\n    Thy feet are firm upon the little sphere,\r\n    On this side answering to Judecca\'s round.\r\n  \'Tis evening yonder when \'tis morning here;\r\n    And he whose tufts our ladder rungs supplied.\r\n    Fixed as he was continues to appear.                           120\r\n  Headlong from Heaven he fell upon this side;\r\n    Whereon the land, protuberant here before,\r\n    For fear of him did in the ocean hide,\r\n  And \'neath our sky emerged: land, as of yore[876]\r\n    Still on this side, perhaps that it might shun\r\n    His fall, heaved up, and filled this depth no more.\'\r\n  From Belzebub[877] still widening up and on,\r\n    Far-stretching as the sepulchre,[878] extends\r\n    A region not beheld, but only known\r\n  By murmur of a brook[879] which through it wends,                130\r\n    Declining by a channel eaten through\r\n    The flinty rock; and gently it descends.\r\n  My Guide and I, our journey to pursue\r\n    To the bright world, upon this road concealed\r\n    Made entrance, and no thought of resting knew.\r\n  He first, I second, still ascending held\r\n    Our way until the fair celestial train\r\n    Was through an opening round to me revealed:\r\n  And, issuing thence, we saw the stars[880] again.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[858] _Vexilla, etc._: \'_The banners of the King of Hell advance._\' The\r\nwords are adapted from a hymn of the Cross used in Holy Week; and they\r\nprepare us to find in Lucifer the opponent of \'the Emperor who reigns on\r\nhigh\' (_Inf._ i. 124). It is somewhat odd that Dante should have put a\r\nChristian hymn into Virgil\'s mouth.\r\n\r\n[859] _Now was I where_: In the fourth and inner division or ring of the\r\nNinth Circle. Here are punished those guilty of treachery to their\r\nlawful lords or to their benefactors. From Judas Iscariot, the\r\narch-traitor, it takes the name of Judecca.\r\n\r\n[860] _Some stood, etc._: It has been sought to distinguish the degrees\r\nof treachery of the shades by means of the various attitudes assigned to\r\nthem. But it is difficult to make more out of it than that some are\r\nsuffering more than others. All of them are the worst of traitors,\r\nhard-hearted and cold-hearted, and now they are quite frozen in the ice,\r\nsealed up even from the poor relief of intercourse with their\r\nfellow-sinners.\r\n\r\n[861] _The creature once, etc._: Lucifer, guilty of treachery against\r\nthe Highest, at _Purg._ xii. 25 described as \'created noble beyond all\r\nother creatures.\' Virgil calls him Dis, the name used by him for Pluto\r\nin the _\xc3\x86neid_, and the name from which that of the City of Unbelief is\r\ntaken (_Inf._ viii. 68).\r\n\r\n[862] _Judge then what bulk_: The arm of Lucifer was as much longer than\r\nthe stature of one of the giants as a giant was taller than Dante. We\r\nhave seen (_Inf._ xxxi. 58) that the giants were more than fifty feet in\r\nheight--nine times the stature of a man. If a man\'s arm be taken as a\r\nthird of his stature, then Satan is twenty-seven times as tall as a\r\ngiant, that is, he is fourteen hundred feet or so. For a fourth of this,\r\nor nearly so--from the middle of the breast upwards--he stands out of\r\nthe ice, that is, some three hundred and fifty feet. It seems almost too\r\ngreat a height for Dante\'s purpose; and yet on the calculations of some\r\ncommentators his stature is immensely greater--from three to five\r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\n[863] _Three faces_: By the three faces are represented the three\r\nquarters of the world from which the subjects of Lucifer are drawn:\r\nvermilion or carnation standing for Europe, yellow for Asia, and black\r\nfor Africa. Or the faces may symbolise attributes opposed to the Wisdom,\r\nPower, and Love of the Trinity (_Inf._ iii. 5). See also note on line 1.\r\n\r\n[864] _A bat\'s wing_: Which flutters and flaps in dark and noisome\r\nplaces. The simile helps to bring more clearly before us the dim light\r\nand half-seen horrors of the Judecca.\r\n\r\n[865] _A heckle_: Or brake; the instrument used to clear the fibre of\r\nflax from the woody substance mixed with it.\r\n\r\n[866] _Sometimes nude_: We are to imagine that the frame of Judas is\r\nbeing for ever renewed and for ever mangled and torn.\r\n\r\n[867] _Cassius_: It has been surmised that Dante here confounds the pale\r\nand lean Cassius who was the friend of Brutus with the L. Cassius\r\ndescribed as corpulent by Cicero in the Third Catiline Oration. Brutus\r\nand Cassius are set with Judas in this, the deepest room of Hell,\r\nbecause, as he was guilty of high treason against his Divine Master, so\r\nthey were guilty of it against Julius C\xc3\xa6sar, who, according to Dante,\r\nwas chosen and ordained by God to found the Roman Empire. As the great\r\nrebel against the spiritual authority Judas has allotted to him the\r\nfiercer pain. To understand the significance of this harsh treatment of\r\nthe great Republicans it is necessary to bear in mind that Dante\'s\r\ndevotion to the idea of the Empire was part of his religion, and far\r\nsurpassed in intensity all we can now well imagine. In the absence of a\r\njust and strong Emperor the Divine government of the world seemed to him\r\nalmost at a stand.\r\n\r\n[868] _Night is rising_: It is Saturday evening, and twenty-four hours\r\nsince they entered by the gate of Inferno.\r\n\r\n[869] _I thought to Hell, etc._: Virgil, holding on to Lucifer\'s hairy\r\nsides, descends the dark and narrow space between him and the ice as far\r\nas to his middle, which marks the centre of the earth. Here he swings\r\nhimself round so as to have his feet to the centre as he emerges from\r\nthe pit to the southern hemisphere. Dante now feels that he is being\r\ncarried up, and, able to see nothing in the darkness, deems they are\r\nclimbing back to the Inferno. Virgil\'s difficulty in turning himself\r\nround and climbing up the legs of Lucifer arises from his being then at\r\nthe \'centre to which all weights tend from every part.\' Dante shared the\r\nerroneous belief of the time, that things grew heavier the nearer they\r\nwere to the centre of the earth.\r\n\r\n[870] _His upturned legs_: Lucifer\'s feet are as far above where Virgil\r\nand Dante are as was his head above the level of the Judecca.\r\n\r\n[871] _What point, etc._: The centre of the earth. Dante here feigns to\r\nhave been himself confused--a fiction which helps to fasten attention on\r\nthe wonderful fact that if we could make our way through the earth we\r\nshould require at the centre to reverse our posture. This was more of a\r\nwonder in Dante\'s time than now.\r\n\r\n[872] _Mid tierce_: The canonical day was divided into four parts, of\r\nwhich Tierce was the first and began at sunrise. It is now about\r\nhalf-past seven in the morning. The night was beginning when they took\r\ntheir departure from the Judecca: the day is now as far advanced in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere as they have spent time on the passage. The journey\r\nbefore them is long indeed, for they have to ascend to the surface of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n[873] _To morn from night_: Dante\'s knowledge of the time of day is\r\nwholly derived from what Virgil tells him. Since he began his descent\r\ninto the Inferno he has not seen the sun.\r\n\r\n[874] _\'Neath whose summit_: Jerusalem is in the centre of the northern\r\nhemisphere--an opinion founded perhaps on _Ezekiel_ v. 5: \'Jerusalem I\r\nhave set in the midst of the nations and countries round about her.\' In\r\nthe _Convito_, iii. 5, we find Dante\'s belief regarding the distribution\r\nof land and sea clearly given: \'For those I write for it is enough to\r\nknow that the Earth is fixed and does not move, and that, with the\r\nocean, it is the centre of the heavens. The heavens, as we see, are for\r\never revolving around it as a centre; and in these revolutions they must\r\nof necessity have two fixed poles.... Of these one is visible to almost\r\nall the dry land of the Earth; and that is our north pole [star]. The\r\nother, that is, the south, is out of sight of almost all the dry land.\'\r\n\r\n[875] _The Man_: The name of Christ is not mentioned in the _Inferno_.\r\n\r\n[876] _Land, as of yore, etc._: On the fall of Lucifer from the southern\r\nsky all the dry land of that hemisphere fled before him under the ocean\r\nand took refuge in the other; that is, as much land emerged in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere as sank in the southern. But the ground in the\r\ndirect line of his descent to the centre of the earth heaped itself up\r\ninto the Mount of Purgatory--the only dry land left in the southern\r\nhemisphere. The Inferno was then also hollowed out; and, as Mount\r\nCalvary is exactly antipodal to Purgatory, we may understand that on the\r\nfall of the first rebels the Mount of Reconciliation for the human race,\r\nwhich is also that of Purification, rose out of the very realms of\r\ndarkness and sin.--But, as Todeschini points out, the question here\r\narises of whether the Inferno was not created before the earth. At\r\n_Parad_. vii. 124, the earth, with the air and fire and water, is\r\ndescribed as \'corruptible and lasting short while;\' but the Inferno is\r\nto endure for aye, and was made before all that is not eternal (_Inf._\r\niii. 8).\r\n\r\n[877] _Belzebub_: Called in the Gospel the prince of the devils. It may\r\nbe worth mentioning here that Dante sees in Purgatory (_Purg._ viii. 99)\r\na serpent which he says may be that which tempted Eve. The\r\nidentification of the great tempter with Satan is a Miltonic, or at any\r\nrate a comparatively modern idea.\r\n\r\n[878] _The sepulchre_: The Inferno, tomb of Satan and all the wicked.\r\n\r\n[879] _A brook_: Some make this to be the same as Lethe, one of the\r\nrivers of the Earthly Paradise. It certainly descends from the Mount of\r\nPurgatory.\r\n\r\n[880] _The stars_: Each of the three divisions of the Comedy closes with\r\n\'the stars.\' These, as appears from _Purg._ i. are the stars of dawn. It\r\nwas after sunrise when they began their ascent to the surface of the\r\nearth, and so nearly twenty-four hours have been spent on the\r\njourney--the time it took them to descend through Inferno. It is now the\r\nmorning of Easter Sunday--that is, of the true anniversary of the\r\nResurrection although not of the day observed that year by the Church.\r\nSee _Inf._ xxi. 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF PROPER NAMES AND PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS OF THE INFERNO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abati, Bocca degli, xxxii. 106.\r\n\r\n  ---- Buoso, xxv. 140.\r\n\r\n  Abbagliato, xxix. 132.\r\n\r\n  Abel, iv. 56.\r\n\r\n  Abraham, iv. 58.\r\n\r\n  Absalom, xxviii. 137.\r\n\r\n  Accorso, Francis d\', xv. 110.\r\n\r\n  Acheron, iii. 78, xiv. 116.\r\n\r\n  Achilles, v. 65, xii. 71, xxvi. 62, xxxi. 4.\r\n\r\n  Acquacheta, xvi. 97.\r\n\r\n  Acre, xxvii. 89.\r\n\r\n  Adam, iii. 115, iv. 55.\r\n\r\n  ---- Master, xxx. 61, etc.\r\n\r\n  Adige, xii. 5.\r\n\r\n  \xc3\x86gina, xxix. 58.\r\n\r\n  \xc3\x86neas, ii. 32, iv. 122, xxvi. 93.\r\n\r\n  \xc3\x86sop, xxiii. 4.\r\n\r\n  Agnello Brunelleschi, xxv. 68.\r\n\r\n  Ahithophel, xxviii. 138.\r\n\r\n  Alardo, xxviii. 18.\r\n\r\n  Alberigo, Friar, xxxiii. 118.\r\n\r\n  Alberto of Siena, xxix. 110.\r\n\r\n  ---- degli Alberti, xxxii. 57.\r\n\r\n  Alchemists, xxix. 43, etc.\r\n\r\n  Aldobrandi, Tegghiaio, vi. 79, xvi. 42.\r\n\r\n  Alecto, ix. 47.\r\n\r\n  Alexander, Count of Romena, xxx. 77.\r\n\r\n  ---- degli Alberti, xxxii. 55.\r\n\r\n  ---- xii. 107, xiv. 31.\r\n\r\n  Alessio Interminei, xviii. 122.\r\n\r\n  Ali, xxviii. 32.\r\n\r\n  Alichino, xxi. 118, xxii. 112.\r\n\r\n  Alps, xiv. 30.\r\n\r\n  Amphiara\xc3\xbcs, xx. 34.\r\n\r\n  Amphion, xxxii. 11.\r\n\r\n  Anastasius, Pope, xi. 8.\r\n\r\n  Anaxagoras, iv. 138.\r\n\r\n  Anchises, i. 74.\r\n\r\n  Andrea, Jacopo da Sant\', xiii. 133.\r\n\r\n  Angels, fallen, iii. 37.\r\n\r\n  Anger, those guilty of, vii. 110, etc.\r\n\r\n  Angiolello, xxviii. 77.\r\n\r\n  Annas, xxiii. 121.\r\n\r\n  Anselmuccio, xxxiii. 50.\r\n\r\n  Ant\xc3\xa6us, xxxi. 100.\r\n\r\n  Antenora, xxxii. 89.\r\n\r\n  Antiochus, xix. 86.\r\n\r\n  Apennines, xvi. 96, xxvii. 29.\r\n\r\n  Apocalypse, xix. 106.\r\n\r\n  Apulia, xxviii. 8.\r\n\r\n  Apulians, xxviii. 16.\r\n\r\n  Aquarius, xxiv. 2.\r\n\r\n  Arachne, xvii. 18.\r\n\r\n  Arbia, x. 86.\r\n\r\n  Aretines, xxii. 5, xxix. 109, xxx. 31.\r\n\r\n  Arethusa, xxv. 99.\r\n\r\n  Argenti, Philip, viii. 61.\r\n\r\n  Argives, xxviii. 84.\r\n\r\n  Ariadne, xii. 20.\r\n\r\n  Aristotle, iv. 131.\r\n\r\n  Arles, ix. 112.\r\n\r\n  Arno, xiii. 147, xv. 113, xxiii. 95, xxx. 65, xxxiii. 83.\r\n\r\n  Arrigo, vi. 80.\r\n\r\n  Arrogance, viii. 46, etc.\r\n\r\n  Arsenal of Venice, xxi. 7.\r\n\r\n  Arthur, King, xxxii. 62.\r\n\r\n  Aruns, xx. 46.\r\n\r\n  Asciano, Caccia d\', xxix. 130.\r\n\r\n  Asdente, xx. 118.\r\n\r\n  Athamas, xxx. 4.\r\n\r\n  Athens, xii. 17.\r\n\r\n  Atropos, xxxiii. 126.\r\n\r\n  Attila, xii. 134, xiii. 149.\r\n\r\n  Augustus, i. 71.\r\n\r\n  Aulis, xx.

Contact the\r\nFoundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\r\n\r\n1.F.\r\n\r\n1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right\r\nof Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\nfees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\r\nLIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\r\nPROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\r\nTRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\r\nLIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\r\nINCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\nDAMAGE.\r\n\r\n1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\r\ndefect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\r\nreceive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\r\nwritten explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\r\nreceived the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\r\nyour written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\r\nthe defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\r\nrefund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\r\nproviding it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\r\nreceive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\r\nis also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\r\nopportunities to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\r\nin paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you \'AS-IS\', WITH NO OTHER\r\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\r\nwarranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\r\nIf any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\r\nlaw of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\r\ninterpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\r\nthe applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\r\nprovision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\r\n\r\n1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
