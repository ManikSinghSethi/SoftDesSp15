I ended up changing the generation number and probability of mutation. the latter makes it more likely for each iteration changing which sometimes caused the distance to deviate from being stuck on the same distance as the distance became closer to zero. increasing the generation number made more iterations and prolonged the process. I actually needed to increase both numbers to be able to get the target message "SKYNET IS NOW ONLINE" to print out.
